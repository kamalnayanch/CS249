      "[\"If the bizarre story about Joan Rivers' doctor pausing to take a selfie in the operating room minutes before the 81-year-old comedienne went into cardiac arrest on August 29 sounded outlandish, that's because it was.\", \"So says Dr Gwen Korovin, Rivers' personal physician who on Thursday night shot down a CNN report claiming Korovin was so star-struck she took the opportunity of her celebrity patient being unconscious to snap a souvenir photo of the two of them together.\", \"CNN, citing sources close to the investigation being carried out by the medical examiner's office, is standing by its claim that a sedated Rivers was clearly visible in Korovin's procedure room selfie - an allegation Korovin's lawyers are calling lies.\", 'Korovin, (known as the patron saint of Broadway singers and actors for her work tending to the likes of Lady Gaga, Hugh Jackman, Julie Andrews, Celine Dion, Mick Jagger and Luciano Pavarotti) also categorically denied performing an unauthorised biopsy on Rivers which, according to multiple published reports, caused the heart attack that killed the beloved New Yorker during what should have been a routine medical procedure.', 'Whatever Rivers would have made of the escalating drama surrounding her mysterious death, those close to her say she would be thrilled by the news that Vanity Fair scribe Leslie Bennetts has been signed to write her biography, due out early next year.', \"Joan Rivers' life story was, in every way, a remarkably dramatic roller-coaster ride characterised by triumphant highs and devastating lows, one that is both wildly entertaining and deeply moving, Bennetts said in a statement.\", \"It's hard to imagine a more compelling subject for a book or one that would be more fun.\", 'And lucrative.', \"Within hours of Rivers' death, sales of her latest book (Diary of a Mad Diva) shot up an impressive - and record-breaking - 70,750pc on Amazon.\", 'Lost in translation.', 'Garth Brooks seems to think his Irish fans were not that put out by the Croke Park debacle.', 'In the run-up to his latest seven-performance run, which kicked off in Atlanta on Friday night, the self-effacing singer-songwriter made reference to his cancelled Irish gigs when asked what the secret is behind his ongoing appeal.', 'I wish I could explain it: Of course - I am beautiful, are you kidding me?', 'I am talented, the 52-year-old joked with reporters.', 'But I do not get it.', '.If the Garth guy shows up or not, these guys are still going to have the same great time, he said, using his Irish fans as a case in point.', 'We saw video footage of people in Ireland, at a bar the night we were supposed to be there, singing Friends in Low Places and they were having the time of their lives.', \"It's like it's their show.\", 'As if.', 'Dowd deals with pot shots.', 'Pulitzer prize-winning journalist Maureen Dowd is on quite a high after learning that she has been cast as the poster girl for a new Consume Responsibly edible pot publicity campaign.', \"The 62-year-old New York Times op-ed columnist, who got (unintentionally) stoned last summer while researching a story about Colorado's recent decision to legalise the use of recreational marijuana, does not even mind that the pro-pot brigade are making fun of her nightmare experience with cannabis to warn rookies about the dangers of overdosing.\", 'Dowd, who decided to test the benefits of pot with a few bites of a weed-infused chocolate bar wrote about the results (What could go wrong?)', 'in a column (titled Do not Harsh Our Mellow, Dude) which was published in June, graphically recalling how - an hour after ingesting the bar, things went haywire.', 'I barely made it from the desk to the bed, where I lay curled up in a hallucinatory state for the next eight hours.', 'I was panting and paranoid, sure that when the room-service waiter knocked and I did not answer, he would call the police and have me arrested for being unable to handle my candy, she wrote.', 'As my paranoia deepened, I became convinced that I had died and no one was telling me.', 'A medical consultant would later tell Dowd that marijuana candy bars are supposed to be cut into 16 pieces for novices, a point she used to condemn the marijuana industry for promoting the drug without safety precautions for first-time users.', \"On Wednesday, the advocacy group Marijuana Policy Project (MPP) responded to Dowd's criticism by unveiling a giant billboard featuring a red-haired woman (who looks exactly like the writer) obviously worse for wear on a hotel room bed.\", 'Do not let a candy bar ruin your vacation, reads the tagline.', 'With edibles, start low and go slow.', 'Dowd, who was not in the slightest fazed at her likeness or her story being used in the ad said she has her own plans for artwork from the billboard.', 'I am going to make it my Christmas card.', 'Now, she said, adding dryly, onto gun control.']\n",

shortening.', 'According to LewRockwell.com:.', 'Feeding high doses of fat and cholesterol to omnivores, like rats and dogs, does not produce atherosclerotic lesions in them .', 'In fact, it turns out that people who have highest percentage of saturated fat in their diets have the lowest risk of heart disease .', 'The last word on this subject should go to Julia Child .', 'Enjoy eating saturated fats, they’re good for you!.', \"Dr. Mercola's Comments:.\", 'The demonization of saturated fat began in 1953, when Dr. Ancel Keys published a paper comparing saturated fat intake and heart disease mortality.', 'His theory turned out to be flimsy, to say the least, but the misguided ousting of saturated fat has continued unabated ever since.', \"Fortunately, the truth is finally starting to come out, as medical scientists have begun to seriously question Keys' findings.\", \"Time to Put Ancel Keys' Theory to Rest.\", 'Keys based his theory on a study of six countries, in which higher saturated fat intake equated to higher rates of heart disease.', 'However, he conveniently ignored data from 16 other countries that did not fit his theory.', 'Had he chosen a different set of countries, the data would have shown that increasing the percent of calories from fat reduces the number of deaths from coronary heart disease.', 'And, as illustrated in the featured article, when you include all 22 countries for which data was available at the time of his study, you find that those who consume the highest percentage of saturated fat have the lowest risk of heart disease.', \"Furthermore, many have now realized that it's the trans fat found in margarine, vegetable shortening, and partially hydrogenated vegetable oils that is the true villain, causing far more significant health problems than saturated fat ever could!.\", 'Still, despite the scientific evidence, the low-fat dogma remains a favorite among most government health authorities.', 'Case in point: the most recent food chart issued by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) in December of last year, recommends reducing your saturated fat intake to a mere seven percent of caloric intake—down from its previously recommended 10 percent….', \"Newer Studies Debunk Keys' Theory.\", \"The USDA's lowered recommendation is illogical when you consider the evidence available today, which supports saturated fat as a necessary part of a heart healthy diet.\", 'For example, as discussed in the featured article, a number of indigenous tribes around the world are living proof that a high-saturated fat diet equates to low mortality from heart disease.', 'These include:.', 'Tribe Primary Diet Percentage Saturated Fat.', 'Maasai tribe in Kenya/Tanzania Meat, milk, cattle blood 66 percent.', 'Inuit Eskimos

least and were the most physically active.', 'Another 2010 study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that a reduction in saturated fat intake must be evaluated in the context of replacement by other macronutrients, such as carbohydrates.', 'When you replace saturated fat with a higher carbohydrate intake, particularly refined carbohydrate, you exacerbate insulin resistance and obesity, increase triglycerides and small LDL particles, and reduce beneficial HDL cholesterol.', 'The authors state that dietary efforts to improve your cardiovascular disease risk should primarily emphasize the limitation of refined carbohydrate intake, and weight reduction.', 'I believe that last point is very important, and is likely a major key for explaining the rampant increase

nutrients that we consume in large amounts and give us energy.', 'Each fat molecule is made of one glycerol molecule and three fatty acids… which can be either saturated, monounsaturated or polyunsaturated.', 'What this saturation stuff has to do with, is the number of double bonds in the molecule.', 'Saturated fatty acids have no double bonds, monounsaturated fatty acids have one double bond and polyunsaturated fatty acids have two or more double bonds.', 'This picture here shows the difference:.', 'Saturated vs Unsaturated Fatty AcidsPhoto Source.', 'Another way to phrase this, is that saturated fatty acids have all their carbon (C) atoms fully saturated with hydrogen (H) atoms.', 'Foods that are high in saturated fat include fatty meats, lard, full-fat dairy products like butter and cream, coconuts, coconut oil, palm oil and dark chocolate.', 'Actually, fats contain a combination of different fatty acids.', 'No fat is pure saturated fat, or pure mono- or polyunsaturated.', 'Even foods like beef also contain a significant amount of mono- and polyunsaturated fats (1).', 'Fats that are mostly saturated (like butter) tend to be solid at room temperature, while fats that are mostly unsaturated (like olive oil) are liquid at room temperature.', 'Like other fats, saturated fat contains 9 calories per gram.', 'Bottom Line: Saturated fats are fats that contain a high proportion of saturated fatty acids, which contain no double bonds.', 'Saturated fats are solid at room temperature.', 'Why do People Think That it is Harmful?.', 'A Single Butter Curl.', 'Back in the 20th century, there was a major epidemic of heart disease running rampant in America.', 'It used to be a rare disease, but very quickly it skyrocketed and became the number one cause of death… which it still is (2).', 'Researchers learned that eating saturated fat seemed to increase levels of cholesterol in the bloodstream.', 'This was an important finding at the time, because they also knew that having high cholesterol was linked to an increased risk of heart disease.', 'This led to the following assumption being made:.', 'If saturated fat raises cholesterol (A causes B) and cholesterol causes heart disease (B causes C), then this must mean that saturated fat causes heart disease (A causes C).', 'However, at the time, this was not based on any experimental evidence in humans.', 'This hypothesis (called the diet-heart hypothesis) was based on assumptions, observational data and animal studies (3).', 'The diet-heart hypothesis then turned into public policy in 1977, before it was ever proven to be true (4).', 'Even though we now have plenty of experimental data in humans showing these initial assumptions to be wrong, people are still being told to avoid saturated fat in order to reduce heart disease risk.', 'Bottom Line: Saturated fats have been assumed to cause heart disease by raising cholesterol in the blood.', 'However, no experimental evidence has ever directly linked saturated fat to heart disease.', 'Saturated Fat Can Raise LDL (The Bad) Cholesterol, But Also HDL (The Good) Cholesterol.', 'It’s important to realize that the word cholesterol is often used inaccurately.', 'Older Male Doctor.', 'HDL and LDL, the good and bad cholesterols, aren’t actually cholesterol… they are proteins that carry cholesterol around, known as lipoproteins.', 'LDL stands for Low Density Lipoprotein and HDL stands for High Density Lipoprotein.', 'All cholesterol is identical.', 'At first, scientists only measured Total cholesterol, which includes cholesterol within both LDL and HDL.', 'Later they learned that while LDL was linked to increased risk, HDL was linked to reduced risk (5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10).', 'Total cholesterol is actually a highly flawed marker because it also includes HDL.', 'So having a high HDL (protective) actually contributes to a high Total cholesterol.', 'Because saturated fat raised LDL levels, it seemed logical to assume that this would increase the risk of heart disease.', 'But scientists mostly ignored the fact that saturated fat also raises HDL.', 'All that being said, new research has shown that LDL isn’t necessarily bad because there are different subtypes of LDL (11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16):.', 'Small, dense LDL: These are small lipoproteins that can penetrate the arterial wall easily, which drives heart disease.', 'Large LDL: These lipoproteins are large and fluffy and don’t easily penetrate the arteries.', 'The small, dense particles are also much more susceptible to becoming oxidized, which is a crucial step in the heart disease process (17, 18, 19).', 'People with mostly small LDL particles have three times greater risk of heart disease, compared to those with mostly large LDL particles (20).', 'So… if we want to reduce our risk of heart disease, we want to have mostly large LDL particles and as little of the small ones as possible.', 'Here’s an interesting bit of information that is often ignored by mainstream nutritionists… eating saturated fat changes the LDL particles from small, dense to Large (21, 22, 23).', 'What this implies is that even though saturated fat can mildly raise LDL, they are changing the LDL to a benign subtype that is associated with a reduced risk of heart disease.', 'Even the effects of saturated fat on LDL aren’t as dramatic as you may think.', 'Although they increase LDL in the short-term, plenty of long-term observational studies find no link between saturated fat consumption and LDL levels (24, 25, 26).', 'It also seems to depend on the chain length of the fatty acid.', 'For example, palmitic acid (16 carbons) may raise LDL, while stearic acid (18 carbons) does not (27).', 'Now scientists have realized that it’s not just about the LDL concentration or the size of the particles, but the number of LDL particles (called LDL-p) floating in the bloodstream.', 'Low-carb diets, which tend to be high in saturated fat, can lower LDL-p, while low-fat diets can have an adverse effect and raise LDL-p (28, 29, 30, 31).', 'Bottom Line: Saturated fats raise HDL (the good) cholesterol and change LDL from small, dense (bad) to Large LDL,

harmful effects of saturated fat are the cornerstone of modern dietary guidelines.', 'Because of that, this topic has received enormous amounts of funding.', 'However… despite decades of research and billions of dollars spent, scientists still haven’t been able to demonstrate a clear link.', 'Several recent review studies that combined data from multiple other studies, found that there really is no link between saturated fat consumption and heart disease.', 'This includes a review of 21 studies with a total of 347,747 participants, published in 2010.', 'Their conclusion: there is absolutely no association between saturated fat and heart disease (32).', 'Another review published in 2014 looked at data from 76 studies (both observational studies and controlled trials) with a total of

randomized controlled trials.', 'According to their review, published in 2011, reducing saturated fat has no effect on death or death from heart disease (34).', 'However, they found that replacing saturated fats with unsaturated fats reduced the risk of cardiac events (but not death) by 14%.', 'This does not imply that saturated fats are bad, just that certain types of unsaturated fats (mostly Omega-3s) are protective, while saturated fats are neutral.', 'So… the biggest and best studies on saturated fat and heart disease show that there is no direct link.', 'It was a myth all along.',

high-heat cooking methods like frying.', 'Foods that are naturally high in saturated fat also tend to be healthy and nutritious, as long as you’re eating quality unprocessed foods.', 'These include

complicated with polyunsaturated fats.', 'When it comes to those, we have both Omega-3s and Omega-6s.', 'We need to get these two types of fatty acids in a certain balance, but most people are eating way too many Omega-6 fatty acids these days (51).', 'It is a good idea to eat plenty of Omega-3s (such as from fatty fish), but most people would do best by reducing their Omega-6 consumption (52).',

very harmful.', 'Trans fats are made by exposing polyunsaturated vegetable oils to a chemical process that involves high heat, hydrogen gas and a metal catalyst.', 'Studies show that trans fats lead to insulin resistance, inflammation, belly fat accumulation and drastically raise the risk of heart disease (53, 54, 55, 56).', 'So eat your saturated fats, monounsaturated fats and Omega-3s… but avoid trans fats and processed vegetable oils like the plague.', 'Bottom Line: The truly harmful fats are artificial trans fats and processed vegetable oils high in Omega-6 fatty acids.', 'Blaming New

Little, a specialist in exercise physiology at the University of British Columbia at Okanagan.', 'Yet he and other researchers report that study participants find interval training more enjoyable than continuous aerobic exercise, making it more likely that people will continue it on their own.', 'Various activities can be adapted to interval training, including cycling, swimming, walking and jogging, especially on a machine like a stationary bike or treadmill.', 'But HIIT is possible indoors and out, for example by alternating sprints with more moderate exercise.', 'The intensity is tailored to an individual’s starting ability.', 'The high-intensity component is set at 80 to 90 percent of the person’s maximum aerobic capacity, Dr. Little said.', 'Researchers commonly use exercise bikes and treadmills to adjust the pace mechanically.', 'However, high-intensity exercise, even just half a minute at a time, is not appropriate for everyone.', 'In a recent report in the American College of Sports Medicine’s Health & Fitness Journal, Dr. Little; his wife, Mary E. Jung, also at the University of British Columbia; and Marcus W. Kilpatrick of the University of South Florida wrote that HIIT is only appropriate for low-risk individuals, moderate-risk individuals who have been cleared for vigorous intensities by a medical professional, and high-risk individuals who are under direct medical supervision during exercise training.', 'Among the physiological benefits of HIIT are the body’s increased ability to use oxygen and insulin, as well as arteries that are more elastic than continuous moderate exercise can achieve.', 'We’ve seen, for example, that interval training is remarkably effective at lowering glucose levels in people with diabetes, Dr. Little said in an interview.', 'Just one session improves a person’s glucose level.', 'A 12-week controlled study in Denmark of high-intensity interval walking for patients with Type 2 diabetes showed it helped control blood glucose levels better than continuous moderate exercise, even though the same number of calories was expended by both groups.', 'Interval training also was more effective at enhancing the patients’ physical fitness and reducing body fat relative to lean muscle tissue.', 'By making blood vessels better able to expand, HIIT can improve the cardiovascular system’s ability to respond to added exertion.', 'Oxygen-carrying blood can flow more smoothly through arteries that are wide open, which also reduces the risk of a vessel-blocking clot.', 'The body’s ability to use oxygen efficiently improves markedly after as little as two weeks of training with HIIT, the researchers wrote.', 'Peak oxygen uptake — the amount of oxygen an individual can use during intense exercise — is considered the best indicator of cardiovascular fitness and an independent predictor of illness and death in cardiac patients.', 'Too many people think incorrectly that high-intensity exercise is only for athletes, that it’s a heart attack waiting to happen, Dr. Little said.', 'On the contrary, the research strongly suggests, it is more likely to reduce the risk of a heart attack.', 'In a 2012 report reviewing the effects of HIIT in patients with coronary artery disease and heart failure, researchers in Canada, France and Switzerland wrote that HIIT appears safe and better tolerated by patients than moderate-intensity continuous exercise and more effective at increasing patients’ peak oxygen uptake, blood vessel flexibility and pumping ability of the heart.', 'Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are often unable to exercise long enough to gain needed health benefits.', 'But they can do HIIT for long periods with less shortness of breath and leg discomfort, researchers at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens have reported.', 'Stroke patients with persistent disabilities can also benefit from HIIT.', 'As rehabilitation specialists at the University of Cincinnati wrote this month in BioPortfolio, stroke patients with residual weakness enter a vicious cycle of limited activity and deconditioning.', 'But while regular aerobic exercise can improve their function and cardiovascular health, preliminary studies, including one in Trondheim, Norway, suggest that patients do even better with HIIT.', 'The Norwegian team reported that the improvements persisted for months after the six-week high-intensity exercise program ended.', 'And Polish researchers demonstrated that HIIT could alleviate the rigidity and excessive muscle tone that makes it difficult for Parkinson’s disease patients to move their arms and legs.', 'The researchers, from the University School of Physical Education in Krakow, Poland, showed in 11 patients with mild to moderate Parkinson’s symptoms that eight weeks of HIIT, three times a week, on a stationary bike had a global benefit, improving both lower and upper body function.', 'Reductions in rigidity and stiffness correlated with an increase in a substance called brain-derived neurotrophic factor, which the researchers suggested could have stimulated the growth and function of nerves normally influenced by dopamine, the neurotransmitter that declines in Parkinson’s disease.']\n",

letter relies on a longer memo in which Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein recommends that Comey be dismissed over his mishandling of the Hillary Clinton email scandal during the campaign.', 'A White House spokesman told Politico that Trump did not request the letters, and had no idea that they were coming.', 'As New York contributor Roger Parloff notes, this memo might have made sense if it was issued on day one of the Trump administration.', 'But for it to suddenly come out on May 9, 2017, after the nation has watched and listened to Trump warmly defend and commend Comey’s conduct in countless tweets and interviews, renders its content simply incredible.', 'Plus, the president’s short letter to Comey says nothing about the Clinton probe, but references the investigation into the Trump campaign’s possible Russia ties, saying, I greatly appreciate you informing me, on three separate occasions, that I am not under investigation.', 'Sure enough, several outlets reported early on Wednesday morning that Comey’s dismissal was actually about Trump’s anger over the FBI’s Russia probe and Comey’s media appearances.', 'The president has reportedly been mulling the move for at least a week — and maybe much longer.', 'It appears this moment from January 22, when Trump greeted Comey by blowing him a kiss and commenting Oh, and there’s James — he’s become more famous than me, was a sign that Comey’s days as director were numbered.', 'According to The Wall Street Journal, in recent months Trump became irritated that Comey was receiving more media attention, and wasn’t using his newfound fame to quash the rumors about Trump’s Russia ties:.', 'The more James Comey showed up on television discussing the FBI’s investigation into possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia, the more the White House bristled, according to aides to President Donald Trump.', 'Frustration was growing among top associates of the president that Mr. Comey, in a series of appearances before a Senate panel, wouldn’t publicly tamp down questions about possible collusion with Russian interference in the 2016 presidential race.', 'A person with knowledge of recent conversations said they wanted Mr. Comey to say those three little words: ‘There’s no ties.’.', 'Politico reports that Trump was particularly angry about Comey confirming to the Senate in March that the FBI had been investigating his campaign since last summer, and the director’s refusal to back up his claim that President Obama wiretapped him.', 'He’d even taken to shouting at his TV over the Russia investigation:.', 'He had grown enraged by the Russia investigation, two advisers said, frustrated by his inability to control the mushrooming narrative around Russia.', 'He repeatedly asked aides why the Russia investigation wouldn’t disappear and demanded they speak out for him.', 'He would sometimes scream at television clips about the probe, one adviser said.', 'Only a handful of top advisers, including Sessions and Rosenstein, knew Trump was planning to fire Comey.', 'According to CNN, the pair started fine-tuning their rationale for firing Comey after they learned Trump wanted him gone.', 'It appears those in the know seriously underestimated the ramifications of the president dismissing the official leading an investigation into his campaign.', 'Sources told Politico that the White House thought Comey’s firing would be win-win, since he’d been criticized by both Democrats and Republicans.', 'Trump called several senators to inform them of his decision on Monday evening, and was reportedly taken aback when Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told him he was making a huge mistake.', 'Nevertheless, Trump’s security aide Keith Schiller was sent to personally deliver Comey’s dismissal letter to FBI headquarters.', 'Apparently the White House was unaware that Comey was in Los Angeles on Tuesday.', 'Like Comey himself, many top White House officials only learned what had happened from media reports.', 'Yet Trump was reportedly annoyed that his staff was caught off guard:.', 'One source familiar with the President’s reaction to TV coverage of the Comey firing told CNN that Trump was upset because he perceived that nobody was defending him on the cable networks.', 'So he dispatched top communications aides Sean Spicer, Kellyanne Conway and Sarah Huckabee Sanders to appear on television to defend the White House, the source said.', 'While Trump is known to put a lot of stock in how things play on cable news, in general the White House doesn’t seem all that concerned about the optics of the situation.', 'Hours after the news broke, the White House announced that Trump will meet with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Wednesday, and a Justice

Clinton email investigation.', 'Comey had been leading an investigation into possible collusion between Trump advisers and Russian officials when he was dismissed by the president.', 'Defending that decision in an interview on NBC News on Thursday, Trump said: And, in fact, when I decided to just do it, I said to myself, I said: ‘You know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made up story, it’s an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should’ve won.’.', 'Trump also said there were three occasions on which Comey assured him he was not under investigation.',

staff support.', 'Read more.', 'In the NBC interview Trump also flatly contradicted his own vice-president and spokesman by saying he decided to fire James Comey before receiving a recommendation from the deputy attorney general.', 'Trump recalled three conversations with Comey about the FBI investigation into Russian interference in last year’s presidential election.', 'First, he said, there was a dinner which was also about Comey’s future, raising the prospect that Trump could threaten his job.', 'He wanted to stay on at the FBI, Trump said, and I said I’ll, you know, consider and see what happens … But we had a very nice dinner, and at that time he told me, ‘You are not under investigation.’’’.', 'Acting FBI director refutes claims that staff lost faith in Comey.', 'Then there were two phone calls, one made by Trump, another by Comey.', 'The president admitted: I actually asked him, yes.', 'I said, ‘If it’s possible would you let me know, am I under investigation?', 'He said: ‘You are not under investigation.’.', 'The revelations are likely to trigger a fresh storm of criticism.', 'Perceptions that Trump fired Comey because of the Russian investigation have been central to the controversy surrounding the dismissal.', 'Meanwhile, Trump asking whether he was under investigation would not be illegal, but highly irregular.', 'On Thursday, Trump’s words earned immediate comparisons with then attorney general Loretta Lynch’s controversial meeting with Bill Clinton last June, during the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server while secretary of state.', 'Matthew Miller, a former spokesman for the Department of Justice, told MSNBC: It’s completely inappropriate for [Trump] to ask that question … It would also be a violation of DoJ rules for James Comey to answer it.', 'Asked at Thursday’s White House press briefing if it was inappropriate for Trump to have asked Comey if he was under investigation, deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said: No, I don’t believe it is.', 'She added: I don’t see it as a conflict of interest and neither do many of the legal scholars who’ve been commenting on it over the last hour.', 'Sanders did not identify which legal scholars that she was referring to.', 'When the president fired Comey on Tuesday, the White House released a memo from deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein that criticised Comey for mishandling last year’s investigation into Hillary Clinton’s emails.', 'Press secretary Sean Spicer claimed it was this memo that prompted Trump to remove Comey, a position backed by vice-president Mike Pence on Wednesday.', 'Pence said in an interview with CNN that Trump had made a decision to accept the recommendation of the deputy attorney general and the attorney general to remove Director Comey.', 'But in the NBC interview, Trump said of Comey: He’s a showboat, he’s a grandstander, the FBI has been in turmoil.', 'You know that, I know that.', 'Everybody knows that.', 'You take a look at the FBI a year ago, it was in virtual turmoil, less than a year ago.', 'It hasn’t recovered from that.', 'He explained: I was going to fire Comey.', 'My decision.', 'I was going to fire Comey.', 'There’s no good time to do it, by the way.', 'I was going to fire regardless of recommendation.', 'The revelation came amid a flurry of reports suggesting that Trump had grown increasingly irate with Comey in recent weeks because of his high profile, his failure to stop leaks, his pursuit of the Russia investigation and his lack of support for the president’s claim that he was wiretapped by Barack Obama.', 'In the end, he fired Comey late on Tuesday afternoon, a move that seemed to take many White House staff by surprise.', 'The official reason given was the FBI director’s mishandling of the investigation into Clinton’s emails.', 'The acting head of the FBI, meanwhile, said on Thursday that Comey enjoyed broad support among its staff – directly contradicting the White House assertion that he had lost the confidence of the FBI rank and file.', 'Confronted at a Senate intelligence committee hearing with the claim of Comey’s unpopularity, Andrew McCabe said: That is not accurate.', 'I can tell you I worked very, very closely [with Comey] from the time we started at the Washington field office, he said.', 'I hold Director Comey in the highest regard for his considerable abilities and his integrity.', 'It is the greatest honour of my professional life to have worked with him.', 'He enjoyed broad support in the FBI and he still does to this day … the vast majority of FBI staff enjoyed a deep and positive connection to Director Comey.', 'In contrast, Sanders told reporters on Thursday that she had been in contact with countless FBI agents via text and email who expressed their support for the decision.', 'She did not identify them or explain why a White House press staffer would be in contact with FBI agents.', 'Earlier on Thursday, Sanders told CBS News Trump was very likely to visit FBI headquarters in the next few days.', 'But later the MSNBC network reported that the visit would not be happening after agency officials told the White House that Trump would not be greeted warmly.', 'Making his first public appearance since Comey’s dismissal, McCabe promised to tell the Senate committee if he came under pressure to shut down the investigation into possible links between Trump’s associates and Russia during last year’s election.', 'He said he had met Trump this week but the Russian investigation did not come up.', 'Asked by Senator Marco Rubio if Comey’s abrupt dismissal would impede the work of the FBI, McCabe was adamant.', 'You cannot stop the men and women of the FBI from doing the right thing and upholding the constitution, he said.', 'Later he said the Russian investigation would be pursued vigorously and completely.', 'To reports of Comey having asked for more resources for the investigation, McCabe said he was not aware of any such request and insisted the Russian investigation had the resources it needed.', 'Opening the hearing on global threats that heard evidence from the heads of the main US intelligence agencies, the committee’s Republican chairman, Richard Burr, said it would not be solely focused on the Trump-Russia enquiry.', 'However, Democratic senators repeatedly returned to the issue.', 'It is impossible to ignore that one of the leaders of the intelligence community is not here with us today, said the top Democrat on the committee, Mark Warner.', 'The president’s firing of FBI director Comey … was a shocking development.', 'The timing of Director Comey’s dismissal to me and many committee members on both sides of the aisle is especially troubling.', 'He was leading an active counterintelligence investigation into any links between the Trump campaign and the Russian government or its representatives, and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russia’s efforts to interfere in our election.', 'For many people, including myself, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that the president’s decision to remove Director Comey was related to this investigation.', 'And that is unacceptable.', 'It emerged on Wednesday evening that the committee had issued a subpoena for the president’s former national security adviser Michael Flynn, requesting documents relevant to the committee’s investigation into Russian interference with the 2016 election.', 'Comey – who found out he had been fired when the news flashed up on a screen behind him when he was addressing staff in Los Angeles – sent a farewell letter to FBI staff on Wednesday.', 'It is very hard to leave a group of people who are committed only to doing the right thing, he wrote.', 'My

it means that they’ve been found floating in the space between cells.', 'And that’s any food, not just GMOs.', 'DNA from GMOs behave no differently than DNA from organic or conventional foods.', 'If you aren’t concerned about the DNA from blueberries transferring into you, then you should not be concerned about DNA from GMOs either.', 'The paper’s deepest flaw is that a negative control was not included in the sequencing experiments.', 'Several recent papers (see here and here) have outlined the importance of including a negative control in experiments where there is very little DNA to account for possible contaminants from the environment and reagents.', '(For a lay introduction to the concept of contaminants in sequencing, see here).', '3) New Study Links GMOs To Gluten Disorders That Affect 18 Million Americans.', 'The article quotes for an alleged study by the Institute for Responsible Technology (IRT).', 'But there is no study on the link of GMOs to gluten allergies.', 'There’s a link to a post on a webpage, but there isn’t a peer-reviewed article.', 'IRT is a one-man band run by activist Jeffrey Smith.', 'It is an NGO that advocates for the elimination of GMOs from our food supply.', 'It’s not a university, college or research institution.', 'It doesn’t do studies.', 'I’ve written about gluten allergies and GMOs.', 'The Celiac Disease foundation has spoken out against the IRT’s report.', 'GMO wheat has not been commercialized, so any association of gluten allergies with the consumption of GMO wheat is on its face absurd.', 'As for charts that track an increase in GMO consumption in general and gluten allergies, it’s a case of association with no causation (i.e.', 'the incidence of gluten allergies have increased over the past decade and the amount of GMOs we eat have increased too.', 'But, so have the number of plasma screens manufactured).', '4) Study Links Genetically Modified Corn to Rat Tumors.', 'This claim is the infamous Seralini paper, which was retracted, and recently republished, in a different journal without being peer reviewed.', 'The paper identified tumors in rats that were fed GMOs and/or the herbicide glyphosate longterm.', 'But the strain of rat used was predisposed to tumors.', 'The paper did not perform statistical analyses and used too few rats, so it was not possible to determine if the tumors were due to the food, the chemical or to the fact that the strain of rats would get tumors regardless of what they were fed.', 'Finally, the findings from Seralini’s paper are contrary to other long-term feeding studies.', 'An overview of the criticisms regarding this paper can be found here.', '5) Glyphosate Induces Human Breast Cancer Cells Growth via Estrogen Receptors.', 'This claim relates to glyphosate, an herbicide used in tandem with herbicide resistant genetically modified crops.', 'The cited paper examines the impact of glyphosate on breast cancer cell growth.', 'In approximately 80 percent of instances of breast cancer, the diseased cells are hormone sensitive, meaning they need estrogen in order to proliferate and spread.', 'These researchers took two breast cancer cell lines: one was estrogen sensitive and one was not, and they examined the impact of increasing amounts of glyphosate on cell growth.', 'They found that glyphosate has similar impact on breast cancer growth as estrogen, although the relationship was not as strong, and it did not have an impact on the proliferation of the non-hormone sensitive breast cancer cell line.', 'The paper had numerous technical problems, including the absence of data on controls, a potentially critical omission.', 'Additionally, there actually seems to be a protective effect at higher concentrations of glyphosate: instead of reaching a saturation point where the addition of glyphosate no longer has an effect on cell growth, there is no significant difference in cellular growth between the cells that received the highest doses of glyphosate and the controls (which is why the data from the controls is an important factor).', 'This experiment was done with cells in a petri dish—what’s called an in vitro tissue-culture experiment.', 'Such research is of limited real-world value.', 'The cells are often finicky and need plenty of TLC in order to grow well; different cell lines can also behave very differently.', 'The authors of the paper note some of these issues, along with the fact that their data doesn’t mesh with previous studies that have examined the impact of glyphosate on cellular proliferation (this previous paper suggests that glyphosate actually protects against cell proliferation in vitro in eight different cancer cell lines and that glyphosate might be developed into an anti-cancer drug!', ').', 'Monsanto wrote a response to the paper noting that many studies examined the potential carcinogenicity of glyphosate and none has found that the compound causes cancer.', 'Some news reports misinterpreted the study, writing that researchers concluded that glyphosate causes cancer when that is not the researchers’ findings: they suggest glyphosate may cause breast cancer to proliferate.', 'Monsanto pointed out that even this finding is contrary to the body of evidence that exists on the topic.', 'The authors admit to this fact and discuss the appropriate next steps to examine this issue in mice/rats models for breast cancer.', 'I think that that’s a great next step.', 'I’d also look at a few more breast-cancer cell lines.', 'This is the most compelling research paper that I’ve read about that suggests a potential health risk surrounding glyphosate.', 'But the study must be reproduced and its issues ironed out.', 'However, as I mentioned, the paper isn’t really about GMOs as a class: keep in mind that only a fraction of GMOs are glyphosate resistant (i.e.', 'Round-up Ready crops) and the use of glyphosate is not limited to GMOs.', 'Additionally, the paper does several experiments with a compound in soybean whose impact on breast cancer cell growth is very similar to that of glyphosate’s—meaning that there are natural compounds in our food that seem to have the same impact on breast-cancer proliferation that this paper’s findings suggest for glyphosate.', 'There does not seem to be a scientific consensus on the topic of soy intake in breast cancer patients, although several publications have examined this issue without finding a positive correlation (examples here, here, and here).', '6) Glyphosate Linked To Birth Defects.', 'No peer reviewed, published scientific study makes such claims.', 'The source of this health concern is a publication by Earth Open Source, an anti-GMO NGO co-founded by an individual who also owns a GMO-testing and certification company, and whose business would clearly benefit through the promotion of anti-GMO sentiments (see About the Authors in this document).', '7) Study Links Glyphosate To Autism, Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s.', 'The paper that led to this health claim does not constitute research.', 'It’s a hypothesis and no research was done to support the hypothesis.', 'The paper was reviewed by science journalist Keith Kloor at Discover Magazine who aptly compared it to a Glenn Beck chalkboard drawing.', 'The claims were printed in a pay-for-play journal (also known as predatory journal), meaning that for a fee, one can get nearly anything published.', 'There have been several exposés on pay-for-play journals, and many scientists believe that the phenomenon is eroding the quality of science (here’s an overview from Nature.com; here’s an exposé of pay for play journals).', '8) Chronically Ill Humans Have Higher Glyphosate Levels Than Healthy Humans.', 'This claim is based on a paper published in the Journal of Environmental and Analytical Toxicology, owned by the Omics publishing group- a notorious predatory publishing company.', 'The authors examined glyphosate levels in humans and different animals.', 'There’s no indication of what the animals were fed, how much, how they were kept or myriad other variables.', 'Any of these could invalidate the study.', 'The researchers do not say anything about the age, sex, weight, height, or genetic background of the humans, or how much they ate, if they washed their food, how long they had been eating organic/conventional diets and, most mind-blowing of all, there’s absolutely no definition for what constitutes being chronically ill. Any single issue that I’ve listed here would be considered a fatal flaw that would exclude the paper from publication in a more prestigious journal.', '9) Studies Link GMO Animal Feed to Severe Stomach Inflammation and Enlarged Uteri in Pigs.', 'In the study on which this claim is based, the researchers gave pigs GMO feed and non-GMO feed and identified the differences between the two groups.', 'The paper has been thoroughly challenged by many journalists and scientists:.', 'Journalist Mark Lynas highlighted the degree to which the data is cherry-picked.', 'The difference in inflammation between the GM-fed and non-GM-fed pigs is apparent only when you break down the degree of inflammation into subcategories, but there’s no difference if you view it as a single category.', 'Overall, there’s a high rate of inflammation for both groups, which is not explained in the paper.', 'At the same time, there are several parameters where GM-feed could be argued as having a protective effect (there are 50 percent fewer heart-abnormalities in pigs fed GM-grain), but this isn’t discussed.', 'As explained by geneticist Anastasia Bodnar, the authors do not analyze the compositional differences in the feed between the two groups.', 'Previous studies have determined that the environment (i.e., water, soil, geography) of a crop has a greater impact on proteins and metabolites than whether or not the crop is a GMO.', 'As such, the differences seen in the pigs may not be due pesticides or presence/absence of the transgenic protein; rather, they are most likely due to differences in composition of the feed.', 'Geneticist Val Giddings notes that the animals had abnormally high rates of pneumonia, which points to the possibility that something wonky was going on.', 'In conclusion, even if the paper’s findings are real, there’s no knowing whether that’s due to something associated with transgenes or not, because the researchers do not account for natural variation in the feed.', '10) GMO risk assessment is based on very little scientific evidence in the sense that the testing methods recommended are not adequate to ensure safety.', 'Let’s set aside the fact that this isn’t a Scientific Study Proving GMOs Can Be Harmful To Human Health, which is the claim set out in the title.', 'There are three papers associated with this bullet point.', 'The first one is a review and I agree with a few of the points it makes.', 'It highlights the need for standardized tests and statistics in animal feeding studies for GMOs, and anyone who followed the Seralini debacle would probably agree.', 'It summarizes papers that have performed feeding studies and their results.', 'However, the review does not remove flawed papers from their overview and nor does it distinguish between feeding studies for GMO crops that have been commercialized vs. crops that have never been submitted for regulatory approval.', 'The paper does not conclude, GMO risk assessment is based on very little scientific evidence.', 'The second paper is also a review piece.', 'The first author is affiliated with Friends of the Earth, an anti-GMO NGO.', 'It does not constitute novel research and has a clear editorial slant.', 'The third paper does not even qualify as a review.', 'It’s a commentary published in 2002 in Nature Biotechnology, which is a high caliber journal.', 'It outlined possible unintended consequences that could happen with a GMO—none of which have ever been documented or identified since then, to the best of my knowledge.', 'In conclusion, despite the title of the article, none of these studies proves or even persuasively suggests that GMOs can be harmful to human health.', 'The majority are either obviously flawed or are not scientific studies.', 'The current scientific consensus regarding GMOs remains unchanged: they are safe and do not pose a health risk to humans.', 'However, a scientific consensus is subject to change if there is sufficient reproducible evidence that may impact it, but none of the studies reviewed here constitute such evidence.']\n",

the United States, literally thousands of people were in his orbit — this theory is dredged up again by the tinfoil hat crowd.', 'And then it slowly fades.', 'At first it seemed the speculation about Seth Rich would die down quickly as well.', 'But then 12 days later, on July 22, WikiLeaks published thousands of private emails from the DNC, and Rich became a politically useful distraction.', 'Julian Assange and WikiLeaks supercharged the Seth Rich rumors.', 'A month before Rich was murdered, the DNC admitted that Russian hackers had broken into its computer network, gaining access to all of the DNC’s emails.', 'The thought of Russian interference in American politics was infuriating to Rich, according to one person who was very close to him, the Washington Post reported: It was crazy.', 'Especially for Seth.', 'He said, ‘Oh, my God.', 'We have a foreign entity trying to get involved in our elections?’ That made him so angry.', 'When WikiLeaks released its dump of DNC emails on July 22, the obvious explanation was that it had obtained those emails from the Russian hackers.', 'This connection was later confirmed by top US intelligence agencies, who concluded with high confidence that DNC servers were hacked by top Russian government hackers, who had then given the emails to WikiLeaks.', 'Moscow most likely chose WikiLeaks because of its self-proclaimed reputation for authenticity, the US intelligence report explained, as well as for its connection to the Russian propaganda outlet Russia Today.', 'But WikiLeaks has repeatedly denied its ties to Russia, and ever since last summer it has used Seth Rich as a way to distract from claims that it abetted Russian interference in the US election.', 'WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange had his own reasons to fear a Clinton presidency — as secretary of state, Clinton wanted to indict Assange for his involvement in releasing the millions of US diplomatic cables leaked by Chelsea Manning.', 'On Dutch television in August 2016, Assange hinted that Rich, not Russia, may have been the source for the WikiLeaks emails.', 'Whistleblowers go to significant efforts to get us material, and often very significant risks, he said.', 'As a 27-year-old, works for the DNC, was shot in the back, murdered just a few weeks ago for unknown reasons as he was walking down the street in Washington.', 'Was he one of your sources then?', 'the anchor asked.', 'We don’t comment on who our sources are, Assange replied.', 'Then why make the suggestion about a young guy being shot in the streets of Washington?', 'the anchor replied.', 'Pressed repeatedly for clarification, Assange concluded that others, others have suggested that.', 'We’re investigating to understand what happened in that situation with Seth Rich.', 'I think it’s a concerning situation; there’s not a conclusion yet.', 'As part of its investigation, WikiLeaks offered a $20,000 prize in August for information about Rich’s murder.', 'This is the point where Seth Rich became a prop in a game of international espionage.', 'Trump supporters and the alt-right amplified the theory that Rich was some kind of Democratic whistleblower or leaker, even though the facts didn’t really fit this pattern.', 'He didn’t have access to the DNC emails, and he had never shown any prowess at hacking — being a data analyst involves a very different set of skills.', 'Besides, the DNC wasn’t the only organization that was hacked: Clinton campaign chair John Podesta’s personal emails, for instance, were stolen separately, as were the emails at the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.', 'Nevertheless, many on the right were inspired by the WikiLeaks insinuations and started to concoct their own conspiracy theories about Rich’s murder.', 'In August, former House speaker and presidential candidate Newt Gingrich told a conservative talk show host that Rich’s death was suspicious.', 'First of all, of course it’s worth talking about, he said.', 'And if Assange says he is the source, Assange may know.', 'That’s not complicated.', 'That same month, Trump adviser Roger Stone claimed, without evidence, that Rich was murdered on his way to meet with the FBI to discuss election fraud.', 'To Trump supporters, the claim that Rich had been murdered by the Clintons had twofold appeal: It reinforced the rumor that the Clintons were shady operatives, and it distracted from the mounting evidence that Russia had interfered with the US election — possibly in collusion with the Trump campaign.', 'In the presidential debate on September 26, Trump famously suggested that it could have been a lone hacker who was responsible for the stolen DNC emails.', 'It could be Russia, but it could also be China.', 'It could also be lots of other people.', 'It also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds, he said.', 'Thanks to a weird miscommunication, the conspiracy theory comes back in May.', 'After the election, the conspiracy theories about Seth Rich faded from public consciousness, as the focus turned instead to the FBI’s investigation of connections between Trump staffers and Russian agents.', 'Suspicions still bubbled in right-wing corners of Reddit and on alt-right websites like Gateway Pundit, and Assange continued to claim that it wasn’t the Russians who provided the hacked emails — but most of America had moved on.', 'But Rich returned to the news last week, when the local TV station FOX 5 DC aired an interview with private investigator Rod Wheeler, who claimed that sources in the FBI told him there was evidence of a connection between Rich and WikiLeaks:.', 'FOX 5 DC: You have sources at the FBI saying that there is information.', 'WHEELER: For sure.', 'FOX 5 DC: .', '.that could link Seth Rich to WikiLeaks?.', 'WHEELER: Absolutely.', 'Yeah.', \"That's confirmed.\", 'Conservative media outlets jumped on the story, which aired the night of Monday, May 15.', 'By Tuesday morning, conservative outlets like Breitbart, the Blaze, and the Daily Caller all had their own pieces relaying Wheeler’s claims.', 'On Tuesday, Fox News added its own revelation: It claimed that an unnamed federal investigator had confirmed that Rich had been in contact with WikiLeaks.', 'I have seen and read the emails between Seth Rich and Wikileaks, the source said, according to Fox News.', 'Fox News additionally claimed this source had evidence that Rich had given thousands of DNC emails to WikiLeaks.', 'This was a two-source story: The report also said that Wheeler had independently corroborated what the anonymous federal investigator had told Fox News.', 'But here’s where it gets confusing.', 'By Tuesday afternoon, Wheeler told CNN that he had misspoken.', 'It turns out he didn’t have any evidence of his own.', 'What had happened, apparently, was that earlier in the week, Fox News had contacted Wheeler for its own story on Rich.', 'That was when Wheeler learned that Fox News had a source alleging there was contact between Rich and WikiLeaks.', 'When Wheeler went on local TV on Monday night to talk about Rich, he believed he was giving viewers a preview of the Fox News story set to run on Tuesday.', 'That, at least, is how Wheeler explained the situation to CNN last Tuesday.', 'Somehow, through miscommunication or sloppy reporting, the Fox News report used Wheeler to back up its claims about the Rich-WikiLeaks connection.', 'This was incorrect, Wheeler said.', 'He had no independent knowledge.', 'I only got that [information] from the reporter at Fox News, he told CNN.', 'Yesterday, after leaving it up for a week, Fox News finally retracted its Seth Rich story, which was down to one anonymous source.', 'The article was not initially subjected to the high degree of editorial scrutiny we require for all our reporting, an editor’s note explained.', 'Upon appropriate review, the article was found not to meet those standards and has since been removed.', 'Conservative media has a field day.', 'It’s unlikely that any of this would have been a big deal had there not been a stunning series of damaging reports about Donald Trump last week.', 'Among other things, it was revealed that Trump had shared state secrets with the Russians, that he had pressured FBI Director James Comey to drop his investigation into ties between Trump affiliates and Russia, and that the Russia probe had reached a current high-level White House official, who many suspect is Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner.', 'One way the conservative media minimized all the bad news was to focus on other stories.', 'The latest Seth Rich allegations became a welcome distraction from the constant revelations coming out of the Washington Post and the New York Times.', 'For instance, while most outlets were covering the revelation that Trump had volunteered classified information to Russians, the alt-right website Breitbart devoted its front page to the Seth Rich conspiracy.', 'Breitbart even slammed the mainstream media for ignoring the rumors about Rich: Silence from Establishment Media over Seth Rich WikiLeaks Report was the title of one story.', 'Fox News in particular devoted outsize attention to the Rich story, repeatedly rehashing the conspiracy theory.', 'On his 10 pm show, Fox pundit Sean Hannity devoted segments to Rich on Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday last week.', 'I am not backing off asking questions even though there is an effort that nobody talk about Seth Rich, he said on Friday night.', 'On Tuesday, even after Fox News retracted the story that ignited the latest round of speculation, Hannity remained convinced that the Seth Rich conspiracy theory had legs.', 'I am not Fox.com or FoxNews.com, he said on his radio show.', 'I retracted nothing.', \"Later that evening, on his television show, Hannity said that for now, he would stop talking about Rich out of respect for the family's wishes.\", 'On Twitter, though, he was defiant, claiming that liberal fascism was trying to silence his voice.', 'Ok TO BE CLEAR, I am closer to the TRUTH than ever, he tweeted.', 'Not only am I not stopping, I am working harder.', 'Please retweet, he added.', 'Rich was an unlucky victim of the conservative media.', 'The recent attention has reignited the old Seth Rich conspiracy theories, bringing forth even more unsubstantiated claims.', 'On Fox News’s Sunday morning talk show, Newt Gingrich repeated his belief that Rich, not Russia, was responsible for the DNC hack.', 'It turns out, it wasn’t the Russians, he said.', 'It was this young guy who, I suspect, was disgusted by the corruption of the Democratic National Committee.', 'On Monday, Assange issued a cryptic tweet using the hashtag #SethRich which fanned the flames even further: WikiLeaks has never disclosed a source.', 'Sources sometimes talk to other parties but identities never emerge from WikiLeaks.', '#SethRich.', 'And on Tuesday, New Zealand file-sharing entrepreneur Kim Dotcom, who is wanted by the US government for copyright infringement and racketeering, claimed that Rich had personally contacted him in 2014, and that the two had talked about a number of topics including corruption and the influence of corporate money in politics.', 'I know that Seth Rich was involved in the DNC leak, Dotcom wrote in a statement.', 'Rich’s family has repeatedly asked news outlets to stop publicizing these rumors.', 'Those theories, which some reporters have since retracted, are baseless, and they are unspeakably cruel, Mary and Joel Rich wrote in a Washington Post op-ed on Tuesday evening.', 'Imagine that instead, every call that comes in is a reporter asking what you think of a series of lies or conspiracies about the death, they wrote.', 'That nightmare is what our family goes through every day.', 'The Riches also pushed back on some of the rumors themselves, stating that the FBI had found no evidence of communication between their son and WikiLeaks, and that Seth had no access to any of the DNC emails that were leaked:.', 'Despite these facts, our family’s nightmare persists.', 'Seth’s death has been turned into a political football.', 'Every day we wake up to new headlines, new lies, new factual errors, new people approaching us to take advantage of us and Seth’s legacy.', 'It just won’t stop.', 'The amount of pain and anguish this has caused us is unbearable.', 'With every conspiratorial flare-up, we are forced to relive Seth’s murder and a small piece of us dies as more of Seth’s memory is torn away from us.', 'But to conspiracy theorists, the facts have never mattered.', 'Fake news always has ulterior motives, and everybody who amplified the Seth Rich conspiracy theories had their own stake in keeping the lies alive.']\n",

      "Climate Change is a Hoax\n",
      "['The basic science behind climate change is actually quite simple.', 'The story began nearly 150 years ago when Irish physicist John Tyndall discovered ‘carbonic acid’ – today known as carbon dioxide – was one of a number of perfectly colourless and invisible gases and vapours to absorb radiant heat.', 'He also realised just how important this was to life on Earth as without such gases it would be held fast in the iron grip of frost.', 'About 40 years later, the Swedish scientist Svante Arrhenius first suggested that increasing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would cause the global temperature to go up, particularly in the Arctic.', 'But the idea remained mostly an academic question until, as he predicted, the mercury started to rise.', 'This is one of the certainties in climate science – the world has got warmer.', 'How do we know that the world has really warmed up?.', 'Last year, the hottest on record for the third year in a row, was about 1.1 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial level, according to Nasa and the Met Office, boosted slightly by the natural El Nino effect.', 'Svalbard in the Arctic has seen average winter temperatures rise by up to a staggering 11C compared to the average between 1961 and 1990. .', 'In addition to thermometer records going back to the 1880s, there is a large amount of natural evidence in the form of glaciers retreating and sea ice melting to record lows, sea levels rising by 20cm, islands disappearing, animals and plants shifting their ranges and spring coming several weeks earlier.', 'Ironically, the famously impassable Northwest Passage – which claimed the lives of numerous explorers trying to find a new trade route to China – is now so free of ice that people can take a cruise through it on a ship powered by the fossil fuels that help cause global warming.', 'It is also certain that greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have increased and that human activity is responsible for this.', 'Helpfully, atmospheric carbon dioxide resulting from fossil fuels has a different isotope signature to the gas produced naturally.', 'As Nasa puts it: There is no question that increased levels of greenhouse gases must cause the Earth to warm in response.', 'How do we know that warming has anything to do with humans?.', 'All this does not scientifically prove beyond all doubt that our greenhouse gases, which also include water vapour, nitrous oxide, ozone and methane, are causing global warming.', 'But the correlation between the two and the evidence of causation first supplied by Tyndall make a compelling argument.', 'It is as near to certain as it is possible to get without conducting a planet-scale experiment.', 'Outside of conspiracy theorists, cranks and some of the ruling US politicians, no one disputes the above is true.', 'Even the UK’s leading ‘sceptic’ think tank, Nigel Lawson’s Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF), agrees.', 'What will happen in the future?.', 'Some commentators, including the GWPF, adopt a so-called ‘lukewarmist’ position, arguing that climate change will not be too bad so there is no need to stop using fossil fuels.', \"They point to beneficial effects such as 'global greening' in which plant growth is boosted by the extra carbon in the air.\", 'Others have claimed humanity is plunging headlong towards catastrophe and possibly even a future in which a tiny band of survivors cluster around the last remaining habitable territory near the poles.', 'Both groups are at odds with the science.', 'As Professor Tim Palmer, an Oxford University physicist who has worked on reports for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), explained in a recent talk at the Royal Society, the ‘scientific consensus’ on climate change is that it could be anything between those two extremes.', 'According to computer models, developed using mathematics, the laws of physics and the best available knowledge, the world could be on course for between about 1.5C and more than 5C of warming as a result of the doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide.', 'So far it has risen from about 280 parts per million – a level that had remained fairly constant from the end of the last Ice Age to the 1800s – to more than 400ppm today.', 'When we talk about scientific consensus, I would say it’s basically about this [temperature] distribution, it’s not individual predictions, Professor Palmer told the Royal Society.', 'But, according to the models, there is a much higher probability of going beyond 2C of warming, than staying below this point, often regarded as when climate change becomes particularly ‘dangerous’.', 'And, as Professor Palmer also pointed out, there is also a non-negligible probability of 5C or more, which would be utterly catastrophic.', 'Models are often the source of derision from climate ‘sceptics’ or ‘deniers’, but they have actually proved remarkably successful when measured against actual observations.', 'Even Arrhenius’ prediction that the Arctic would warm more quickly has proved to be true.']\n",

Americans were obese, and coronary heart disease was unknown.', 'The Procter and Gamble started marketing Crisco as a new kind of food .', 'the first commercially marketed trans fat.', 'Crisco was originally used to make candles and soap, but with electrification causing a decline in candle sales,.', 'Procter and Gamble decided to promote the fat as a healthier all-vegetable-derived shortening.', 'According to LewRockwell.com:.', 'Feeding high doses of fat and cholesterol to omnivores, like rats and dogs, does not produce atherosclerotic lesions in them .', 'In fact, it turns out that people who have highest percentage of saturated fat in their diets have the lowest risk of heart disease .', 'The last word on this subject should go to Julia Child .', 'Enjoy eating saturated fats, they’re good for you!.', \"Dr. Mercola's Comments:.\", 'The demonization of saturated fat began in 1953, when Dr. Ancel Keys published a paper comparing saturated fat intake and heart disease mortality.', 'His theory turned out to be flimsy, to say the least, but the misguided ousting of saturated fat has continued unabated ever since.', \"Fortunately, the truth is finally starting to come out, as medical scientists have begun to seriously question Keys' findings.\", \"Time to Put Ancel Keys' Theory to Rest.\", 'Keys based his theory on a study of six countries, in which higher saturated fat intake equated to higher rates of heart disease.', 'However, he conveniently ignored data from 16 other countries that did not fit his theory.', 'Had he chosen a different set of countries, the data would have shown that increasing the percent of calories from fat reduces the number of deaths from coronary heart disease.', 'And, as illustrated in the featured article, when you include all 22 countries for which data was available at the time of his study, you find that those who consume the highest percentage of saturated fat have the lowest risk of heart disease.', \"Furthermore, many have now realized that it's the trans fat found in margarine, vegetable shortening, and partially hydrogenated vegetable oils that is the true villain, causing far more significant health problems than saturated fat ever could!.\", 'Still, despite the scientific evidence, the low-fat dogma remains a favorite among most government health authorities.', 'Case in point: the most recent food chart issued by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) in December of last year, recommends reducing your saturated fat intake to a mere seven percent of caloric intake—down from its previously recommended 10 percent….', \"Newer Studies Debunk Keys' Theory.\", \"The USDA's lowered recommendation is illogical when you consider the evidence available today, which supports saturated fat as a necessary part of a heart healthy diet.\", 'For example, as discussed in the featured article, a number of indigenous tribes around the world are living proof that a high-saturated fat diet equates to low mortality from heart disease.', 'These include:.', 'Tribe Primary Diet Percentage Saturated Fat.', 'Maasai tribe in Kenya/Tanzania Meat, milk, cattle blood 66 percent.', 'Inuit Eskimos in the Arctic Whale meat and blubber 75 percent.', 'Rendille tribe in NE Kenya Camel milk, meat, blood 63 percent.', 'Tokealu, atoll islands in New Zealand territory Fish and coconuts 60 percent.', \"And then there's human breast milk, which contains 54 percent saturated fat.\", 'Since breast milk is the most perfect diet in existence for developing infants, the presence of high amounts of saturated fat cannot easily be construed as a mistake.', 'Furthermore:.', 'A meta-analysis published last year, which pooled data from 21 studies and included nearly 348,000 adults, found no difference in the risks of heart disease and stroke between people with the lowest and highest intakes of saturated fat.', 'In a 1992 editorial published in the Archives of Internal Medicine, Dr. William Castelli, a former director of the Framingham Heart study, stated:.', \"In Framingham, Mass., the more saturated fat one ate, the more cholesterol one ate, the more calories one ate, the lower the person's serum cholesterol.\", 'The opposite of what… Keys et al would predict…We found that the people who ate the most cholesterol, ate the most saturated fat, ate the most calories, weighed the least and were the most physically active.', 'Another 2010 study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that a reduction in saturated fat intake must be evaluated in the context of replacement by other macronutrients, such as carbohydrates.', 'When you replace saturated fat with a higher carbohydrate intake, particularly refined carbohydrate, you exacerbate insulin resistance and obesity, increase triglycerides and small LDL particles, and reduce beneficial HDL cholesterol.', 'The authors state that dietary efforts to improve your cardiovascular disease risk should primarily emphasize the limitation of refined carbohydrate intake, and weight reduction.', 'I believe that last point is very important, and is likely a major key for explaining the rampant increase in obesity, heart disease and diabetes.', 'And once you can pinpoint the problem, turning it all around becomes that much easier.', 'Carbohydrates, Not Fat, is the Root of Obesity and Heart Disease.', \"Heart disease is so common today, it's hard for people to remember that a mere 100 years ago, this disease was really uncommon.\", 'As Dr. Donald Miller writes in the featured article:.', 'There were 500 cardiologists practicing in the U.S. in 1950.', 'There are 30,000 of them now – a 60-fold increase for a population that has only doubled since 1950. .', 'Such an explosion of heart disease indicates that something has changed that is contributing to this epidemic.', 'What is that something?.', 'Our diet!.', 'Most likely, the studies that have linked the so-called Western diet to an increased heart disease risk simply confirm that sugar and refined carbohydrates are harmful to your heart health.', \"Because although the Western diet is high in red and processed meats and saturated fats, it's also alarmingly high in sugar and refined carbs like bread and pasta.\", 'And, as concluded in the last study listed above, when you reduce saturated fat and increase refined carbohydrates, you end up promoting obesity, heart disease and diabetes.', 'Gary Taubes has also done an excellent job of explaining the connection between carbs and obesity and its related health issues in his book Why We Get Fat: and what to do about it.', 'In a nutshell, eating fat and protein does not make you fat—carbohydrates do.I firmly believe the two primary keys for successful weight management and reducing your risk for diabetes, heart disease and other weight-related health problems are:.', 'Severely restricting carbohydrates (sugars, fructose, and grains) in your diet, and.', 'Increasing healthy fat consumption.', \"According to last year's Report of the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee on the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, the top 10 sources of calories in the

health problems, not saturated fats.', '(As an update, you have often heard me state that soda is the number one source of calories in the US diet, which it was—based on the 1999-2000 National Health

overabundance of these oils in processed foods of all kinds explains our excess omega-6 levels.', 'The other fats you want to avoid are the trans fats.', 'Trans fats are formed when hydrogen is added to vegetable oil during food processing in order to make it solidify.', 'This process, known as hydrogenation, makes fats less likely to spoil, so foods stay fresh longer, have a longer shelf life and

      "['We’ve been told that saturated fat is unhealthy.', 'It is claimed to raise cholesterol levels and give us heart attacks.', 'However… many recent studies suggest that the true picture is more complicated than that.', 'This article takes a detailed look at saturated fat and whether it is good or bad for your health.', 'What is Saturated Fat?.', 'Fats are macronutrients.', 'That is, nutrients that we consume in large amounts and give us energy.', 'Each fat molecule is made of one glycerol molecule and three fatty acids… which can be either saturated, monounsaturated or polyunsaturated.', 'What this saturation stuff has to do with, is the number of double bonds in the molecule.', 'Saturated fatty acids have no double bonds, monounsaturated fatty acids have one double bond and polyunsaturated fatty acids have two or more double bonds.', 'This picture here shows the difference:.', 'Saturated vs Unsaturated Fatty AcidsPhoto Source.', 'Another way to phrase this, is that saturated fatty acids have all their carbon (C) atoms fully saturated with hydrogen (H) atoms.', 'Foods that are high in saturated fat include fatty meats, lard, full-fat dairy products like butter and cream, coconuts, coconut oil, palm oil and dark chocolate.', 'Actually, fats contain a combination of different fatty acids.', 'No fat is pure saturated fat, or pure mono- or polyunsaturated.', 'Even foods like beef also contain a significant amount of mono- and polyunsaturated fats (1).', 'Fats that are mostly saturated (like butter) tend to be solid at room temperature, while fats that are mostly unsaturated (like olive oil) are liquid at room temperature.', 'Like other fats, saturated fat contains 9 calories per gram.', 'Bottom Line: Saturated fats are fats that contain a high proportion of saturated fatty acids, which contain no double bonds.', 'Saturated fats are solid at room temperature.', 'Why do People Think That it is Harmful?.', 'A Single Butter Curl.', 'Back in the 20th century, there was a major epidemic of heart disease running rampant in America.', 'It used to be a rare disease, but very quickly it skyrocketed and became the number one cause of death… which it still is (2).', 'Researchers learned that eating saturated fat seemed to increase levels of cholesterol in the bloodstream.', 'This was an important finding at the time, because they also knew that having high cholesterol was linked to an increased risk of heart disease.', 'This led to the following assumption being made:.', 'If saturated fat raises cholesterol (A causes B) and cholesterol causes heart disease (B causes C), then this must mean that saturated fat causes heart disease (A causes C).', 'However, at the time, this was not based on any experimental evidence in humans.', 'This hypothesis (called the diet-heart hypothesis) was based on assumptions, observational data and animal studies (3).', 'The diet-heart hypothesis then turned into public policy in 1977, before it was ever proven to be true (4).', 'Even though we now have plenty of experimental data in humans showing these initial assumptions to be wrong, people are still being told to avoid saturated fat in order to reduce heart disease risk.', 'Bottom Line: Saturated fats have been assumed to cause heart disease by raising cholesterol in the blood.', 'However, no experimental evidence has ever directly linked saturated fat to heart disease.', 'Saturated Fat Can Raise LDL (The Bad) Cholesterol, But Also HDL (The Good) Cholesterol.', 'It’s important to realize that the word cholesterol is often used inaccurately.', 'Older Male Doctor.', 'HDL and LDL, the good and bad cholesterols, aren’t actually cholesterol… they are proteins that carry cholesterol around, known as lipoproteins.', 'LDL stands for Low Density Lipoprotein and HDL stands for High Density Lipoprotein.', 'All cholesterol is identical.', 'At first, scientists only measured Total cholesterol, which includes cholesterol within both LDL and HDL.', 'Later they learned that while LDL was linked to increased risk, HDL was linked to reduced risk (5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10).', 'Total cholesterol is actually a highly flawed marker because it also includes HDL.', 'So having a high HDL (protective) actually contributes to a high Total cholesterol.', 'Because saturated fat raised LDL levels, it seemed logical to assume that this would increase the risk of heart disease.', 'But scientists mostly ignored the fact that saturated fat also raises HDL.', 'All that being said, new research has shown that LDL isn’t necessarily bad because there are different subtypes of LDL (11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16):.', 'Small, dense LDL: These are small lipoproteins that can penetrate the arterial wall easily, which drives heart disease.', 'Large LDL: These lipoproteins are large and fluffy and don’t easily penetrate the arteries.', 'The small, dense particles are also much more susceptible to becoming oxidized, which is a crucial step in the heart disease process (17, 18, 19).', 'People with mostly small LDL particles have three times greater risk of heart disease, compared to those with mostly large LDL particles (20).', 'So… if we want to reduce our risk of heart disease, we want to have mostly large LDL particles and as little of the small ones as possible.', 'Here’s an interesting bit of information that is often ignored by mainstream nutritionists… eating saturated fat changes the LDL particles from small, dense to Large (21, 22, 23).', 'What this implies is that even though saturated fat can mildly raise LDL, they are changing the LDL to a benign subtype that is associated with a reduced risk of heart disease.', 'Even the effects of saturated fat on LDL aren’t as dramatic as you may think.', 'Although they increase LDL in the short-term, plenty of long-term observational studies find no link between saturated fat consumption and LDL levels (24, 25, 26).', 'It also seems to depend on the chain length of the fatty acid.', 'For example, palmitic acid (16 carbons) may raise LDL, while stearic acid (18 carbons) does not (27).', 'Now scientists have realized that it’s not just about the LDL concentration or the size of the particles, but the number of LDL particles (called LDL-p) floating in the bloodstream.', 'Low-carb diets, which tend to be high in saturated fat, can lower LDL-p, while low-fat diets can have an adverse effect and raise LDL-p (28, 29, 30, 31).', 'Bottom Line: Saturated fats raise HDL (the good) cholesterol and change LDL from small, dense (bad) to Large LDL, which is mostly benign.', 'Overall, saturated fats do not harm the blood lipid profile like previously believed.', 'Does Saturated Fat Cause Heart Disease?.', 'Old Man Taking Pills.', 'The supposedly harmful effects of saturated fat are the cornerstone of modern dietary guidelines.', 'Because of that, this topic has received enormous amounts of funding.', 'However… despite decades of research and billions of dollars spent, scientists still haven’t been able to demonstrate a clear link.', 'Several recent review studies that combined data from multiple other studies, found that there really is no link between saturated fat consumption and heart disease.', 'This includes a review of 21 studies with a total of 347,747 participants, published in 2010.', 'Their conclusion: there is absolutely no association between saturated fat and heart disease (32).', 'Another review published in 2014 looked at data from 76 studies (both observational studies and controlled trials) with a total of 643,226 participants.', 'They found no link between saturated fat and heart disease (33).', 'We also have a systematic review from the Cochrane collaboration, which combines data from numerous randomized controlled trials.', 'According to their review, published in 2011, reducing saturated fat has no effect on death or death from heart disease (34).', 'However, they found that replacing saturated fats with unsaturated fats reduced the risk of cardiac events (but not death) by 14%.', 'This does not imply that saturated fats are bad, just that certain types of unsaturated fats (mostly Omega-3s) are protective, while saturated fats are neutral.', 'So… the biggest and best studies on saturated fat and heart disease show that there is no direct link.', 'It was a myth all along.', 'Unfortunately, the governments and mainstream health organizations seem reluctant to change their minds and continue to promote the old low-fat dogma.', 'For more, read this review of 5 recent studies on saturated fat and health.', 'Bottom Line: The link between saturated fat and heart disease has been studied intensely for decades, but the biggest and best studies show that there is no statistically significant association.', 'Does a Diet Low in Saturated Fat Have Any Health Benefits, or Help You Live Longer?.', 'Frustrated Young Woman With Vegetables on a Plate.', 'Several massive studies have been conducted on the low-fat diet.', 'This is the diet recommended by the USDA and mainstream health organizations all over the world.', 'The main purpose of this diet, is to reduce the intake of saturated fat and cholesterol.', 'This diet also recommends increased consumption of fruits, vegetables and whole grains… along with reduced consumption of sugar.', 'The Women’s Health Initiative was the biggest nutrition study in history.', 'It was a randomized controlled trial with 46,835 women, who were instructed to eat a low-fat diet.', 'After 7.5-8 years, there was only 0.4 kg (1 pound) difference in weight and there was zero difference in heart disease, cancer or death (35, 36, 37, 38).', 'Other massive studies have confirmed this… the low-fat diet provides no benefit for heart disease or the risk of death (39, 40).', 'Several studies that replaced saturated fat with polyunsaturated vegetable oils showed that more people in the vegetable oil groups ended up dying (41, 42).', 'It is interesting to see that since the low-fat guidelines came out, the prevalence of obesity has skyrocketed (43):.', 'Low Fat Guidelines and Obesity Epidemic.', 'This graph shows that the obesity epidemic started full-force at the same time the low-fat advice was peaking.', 'The type 2 diabetes epidemic followed soon after.', 'Of course, this graph alone doesn’t prove anything (correlation does not equal causation), but it does make sense that replacing traditional foods like butter and meat with processed low-fat foods high in sugar had something to do with it.', 'It’s also interesting when looking at the literature, that in almost every single study comparing the expert approved low-fat diet to other diets (including paleo, vegan, low-carb and Mediterranean), it loses (44, 45, 46, 47).', 'Bottom Line: Studies on the low-fat diet do not show a reduced risk of heart disease or death and some studies show that replacing saturated fat with vegetable oils increases the risk.', 'People With Certain Medical Conditions May Want to Minimize Saturated Fat.', 'Suspicious Doctor.', 'The results of most studies are based on averages.', 'The studies clearly show that, on average, saturated fat does not raise the risk of heart disease.', 'However, within those averages, there is room for individual variability.', 'Perhaps most individuals see no effect… while others experience decreased risk and yet others experience an increased risk.', 'That being said, there are definitely some people who may want to minimize saturated fat in the diet.', 'This includes individuals with a genetic disorder called Familial Hypercholesterolemia, as well as people who have a gene variant called ApoE4 (48).', 'With time, the science of genetics will most surely discover more ways in which diet affects our individual risk for disease.', 'Bottom Line: Some people may want to minimize saturated fat intake, including people with Familial Hypercholesterolemia or a gene called ApoE4.', 'Saturated Fat is Excellent for Cooking and Foods That Are High in it Tend to be Healthy and Nutritious.', 'Saturated fat has some important beneficial aspects that are rarely mentioned.', 'Chef Holding Bell Pepper and Meat.', 'For example, saturated fats are excellent for cooking.', 'Because they have no double bonds, they are highly resistant to heat-induced damage (49).', 'Polyunsaturated fats, on the other hand, easily oxidize when they’re heated (50).', 'For this reason, coconut oil, lard and butter are all excellent choices for cooking, especially for high-heat cooking methods like frying.', 'Foods that are naturally high in saturated fat also tend to be healthy and nutritious, as long as you’re eating quality unprocessed foods.', 'These include naturally fed/raised meats, dairy products from grass-fed cows, dark chocolate and coconuts.', 'Bottom Line: Saturated fats are excellent cooking fats and foods that are high in saturated fat tend to be both healthy and nutritious.', 'The Bad Fats You Should Avoid Like The Plague.', 'Bottles of Vegetable Oil.', 'There are many different types of fat.', 'Some of them are good for us, others neutral, yet others are clearly harmful.', 'The evidence points to saturated and monounsaturated fats being perfectly safe and maybe even downright healthy.', 'However… the situation is a bit more complicated with polyunsaturated fats.', 'When it comes to those, we have both Omega-3s and Omega-6s.', 'We need to get these two types of fatty acids in a certain balance, but most people are eating way too many Omega-6 fatty acids these days (51).', 'It is a good idea to eat plenty of Omega-3s (such as from fatty fish), but most people would do best by reducing their Omega-6 consumption (52).', 'The best way to do that is to avoid seed- and vegetable oils like soybean and corn oils, as well as the processed foods that contain them.', 'Another class of fats, artificial trans fats, is also very harmful.', 'Trans fats are made by exposing polyunsaturated vegetable oils to a chemical process that involves high heat, hydrogen gas and a metal catalyst.', 'Studies show that trans fats lead to insulin resistance, inflammation, belly fat accumulation and drastically raise the risk of heart disease (53, 54, 55, 56).', 'So eat your saturated fats, monounsaturated fats and Omega-3s… but avoid trans fats and processed vegetable oils like the plague.', 'Bottom Line: The truly harmful fats are artificial trans fats and processed vegetable oils high in Omega-6 fatty acids.', 'Blaming New Health Problems on Old Foods Doesn’t Make Sense.', 'The health authorities have spent an immense amount of resources studying the link between saturated fat and heart disease.', 'Despite thousands of scientists, decades of work and billions of dollars spent, this hypothesis still hasn’t been supported by any good evidence.', 'The saturated fat myth wasn’t proven in the past, isn’t proven today and never will be proven… because it’s just flat out wrong.', 'Not only is this myth NOT supported by scientific evidence, it is easily refuted with some plain common sense….', 'Humans and pre-humans have been eating saturated fat for hundreds of thousands (if not millions) of years, but the heart disease epidemic started a hundred years ago.', 'Blaming new health problems on old foods just doesn’t

      "Trump fires FBI's Comey over Clinton email investigation\n",
      "['The White House says that President Trump fired James Comey on Tuesday because he received a brief letter from Attorney General Jeff Sessions calling for the FBI director’s dismissal.', 'That letter relies on a longer memo in which Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein recommends that Comey be dismissed over his mishandling of the Hillary Clinton email scandal during the campaign.', 'A White House spokesman told Politico that Trump did not request the letters, and had no idea that they were coming.', 'As New York contributor Roger Parloff notes, this memo might have made sense if it was issued on day one of the Trump administration.', 'But for it to suddenly come out on May 9, 2017, after the nation has watched and listened to Trump warmly defend and commend Comey’s conduct in countless tweets and interviews, renders its content simply incredible.', 'Plus, the president’s short letter to Comey says nothing about the Clinton probe, but references the investigation into the Trump campaign’s possible Russia ties, saying, I greatly appreciate you informing me, on three separate occasions, that I am not under investigation.', 'Sure enough, several outlets reported early on Wednesday morning that Comey’s dismissal was actually about Trump’s anger over the FBI’s Russia probe and Comey’s media appearances.', 'The president has reportedly been mulling the move for at least a week — and maybe much longer.', 'It appears this moment from January 22, when Trump greeted Comey by blowing him a kiss and commenting Oh, and there’s James — he’s become more famous than me, was a sign that Comey’s days as director were numbered.', 'According to The Wall Street Journal, in recent months Trump became irritated that Comey was receiving more media attention, and wasn’t using his newfound fame to quash the rumors about Trump’s Russia ties:.', 'The more James Comey showed up on television discussing the FBI’s investigation into possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia, the more the White House bristled, according to aides to President Donald Trump.', 'Frustration was growing among top associates of the president that Mr. Comey, in a series of appearances before a Senate panel, wouldn’t publicly tamp down questions about possible collusion with Russian interference in the 2016 presidential race.', 'A person with knowledge of recent conversations said they wanted Mr. Comey to say those three little words: ‘There’s no ties.’.', 'Politico reports that Trump was particularly angry about Comey confirming to the Senate in March that the FBI had been investigating his campaign since last summer, and the director’s refusal to back up his claim that President Obama wiretapped him.', 'He’d even taken to shouting at his TV over the Russia investigation:.', 'He had grown enraged by the Russia investigation, two advisers said, frustrated by his inability to control the mushrooming narrative around Russia.', 'He repeatedly asked aides why the Russia investigation wouldn’t disappear and demanded they speak out for him.', 'He would sometimes scream at television clips about the probe, one adviser said.', 'Only a handful of top advisers, including Sessions and Rosenstein, knew Trump was planning to fire Comey.', 'According to CNN, the pair started fine-tuning their rationale for firing Comey after they learned Trump wanted him gone.', 'It appears those in the know seriously underestimated the ramifications of the president dismissing the official leading an investigation into his campaign.', 'Sources told Politico that the White House thought Comey’s firing would be win-win, since he’d been criticized by both Democrats and Republicans.', 'Trump called several senators to inform them of his decision on Monday evening, and was reportedly taken aback when Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told him he was making a huge mistake.', 'Nevertheless, Trump’s security aide Keith Schiller was sent to personally deliver Comey’s dismissal letter to FBI headquarters.', 'Apparently the White House was unaware that Comey was in Los Angeles on Tuesday.', 'Like Comey himself, many top White House officials only learned what had happened from media reports.', 'Yet Trump was reportedly annoyed that his staff was caught off guard:.', 'One source familiar with the President’s reaction to TV coverage of the Comey firing told CNN that Trump was upset because he perceived that nobody was defending him on the cable networks.', 'So he dispatched top communications aides Sean Spicer, Kellyanne Conway and Sarah Huckabee Sanders to appear on television to defend the White House, the source said.', 'While Trump is known to put a lot of stock in how things play on cable news, in general the White House doesn’t seem all that concerned about the optics of the situation.', 'Hours after the news broke, the White House announced that Trump will meet with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Wednesday, and a Justice Department official suggested that there could be more firings.', 'There is a lot of cleaning house that needs to be done, the official said.']\n",

      "Trump fires FBI's Comey over Clinton email investigation\n",
      "['Donald Trump has said he was thinking of this Russia thing when he decided James Comey’s fate – contradicting the White House rationale that he fired the FBI director for mishandling the Clinton email investigation.', 'Comey had been leading an investigation into possible collusion between Trump advisers and Russian officials when he was dismissed by the president.', 'Defending that decision in an interview on NBC News on Thursday, Trump said: And, in fact, when I decided to just do it, I said to myself, I said: ‘You know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made up story, it’s an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should’ve won.’.', 'Trump also said there were three occasions on which Comey assured him he was not under investigation.', 'The president said he called the director of the FBI to ask for an update on a possible criminal investigation into his ties with Russia.', 'Acting FBI head disputes White House claim Comey had lost staff support.', 'Read more.', 'In the NBC interview Trump also flatly contradicted his own vice-president and spokesman by saying he decided to fire James Comey before receiving a recommendation from the deputy attorney general.', 'Trump recalled three conversations with Comey about the FBI investigation into Russian interference in last year’s presidential election.', 'First, he said, there was a dinner which was also about Comey’s future, raising the prospect that Trump could threaten his job.', 'He wanted to stay on at the FBI, Trump said, and I said I’ll, you know, consider and see what happens … But we had a very nice dinner, and at that time he told me, ‘You are not under investigation.’’’.', 'Acting FBI director refutes claims that staff lost faith in Comey.', 'Then there were two phone calls, one made by Trump, another by Comey.', 'The president admitted: I actually asked him, yes.', 'I said, ‘If it’s possible would you let me know, am I under investigation?', 'He said: ‘You are not under investigation.’.', 'The revelations are likely to trigger a fresh storm of criticism.', 'Perceptions that Trump fired Comey because of the Russian investigation have been central to the controversy surrounding the dismissal.', 'Meanwhile, Trump asking whether he was under investigation would not be illegal, but highly irregular.', 'On Thursday, Trump’s words earned immediate comparisons with then attorney general Loretta Lynch’s controversial meeting with Bill Clinton last June, during the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server while secretary of state.', 'Matthew Miller, a former spokesman for the Department of Justice, told MSNBC: It’s completely inappropriate for [Trump] to ask that question … It would also be a violation of DoJ rules for James Comey to answer it.', 'Asked at Thursday’s White House press briefing if it was inappropriate for Trump to have asked Comey if he was under investigation, deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said: No, I don’t believe it is.', 'She added: I don’t see it as a conflict of interest and neither do many of the legal scholars who’ve been commenting on it over the last hour.', 'Sanders did not identify which legal scholars that she was referring to.', 'When the president fired Comey on Tuesday, the White House released a memo from deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein that criticised Comey for mishandling last year’s investigation into Hillary Clinton’s emails.', 'Press secretary Sean Spicer claimed it was this memo that prompted Trump to remove Comey, a position backed by vice-president Mike Pence on Wednesday.', 'Pence said in an interview with CNN that Trump had made a decision to accept the recommendation of the deputy attorney general and the attorney general to remove Director Comey.', 'But in the NBC interview, Trump said of Comey: He’s a showboat, he’s a grandstander, the FBI has been in turmoil.', 'You know that, I know that.', 'Everybody knows that.', 'You take a look at the FBI a year ago, it was in virtual turmoil, less than a year ago.', 'It hasn’t recovered from that.', 'He explained: I was going to fire Comey.', 'My decision.', 'I was going to fire Comey.', 'There’s no good time to do it, by the way.', 'I was going to fire regardless of recommendation.', 'The revelation came amid a flurry of reports suggesting that Trump had grown increasingly irate with Comey in recent weeks because of his high profile, his failure to stop leaks, his pursuit of the Russia investigation and his lack of support for the president’s claim that he was wiretapped by Barack Obama.', 'In the end, he fired Comey late on Tuesday afternoon, a move that seemed to take many White House staff by surprise.', 'The official reason given was the FBI director’s mishandling of the investigation into Clinton’s emails.', 'The acting head of the FBI, meanwhile, said on Thursday that Comey enjoyed broad support among its staff – directly contradicting the White House assertion that he had lost the confidence of the FBI rank and file.', 'Confronted at a Senate intelligence committee hearing with the claim of Comey’s unpopularity, Andrew McCabe said: That is not accurate.', 'I can tell you I worked very, very closely [with Comey] from the time we started at the Washington field office, he said.', 'I hold Director Comey in the highest regard for his considerable abilities and his integrity.', 'It is the greatest honour of my professional life to have worked with him.', 'He enjoyed broad support in the FBI and he still does to this day … the vast majority of FBI staff enjoyed a deep and positive connection to Director Comey.', 'In contrast, Sanders told reporters on Thursday that she had been in contact with countless FBI agents via text and email who expressed their support for the decision.', 'She did not identify them or explain why a White House press staffer would be in contact with FBI agents.', 'Earlier on Thursday, Sanders told CBS News Trump was very likely to visit FBI headquarters in the next few days.', 'But later the MSNBC network reported that the visit would not be happening after agency officials told the White House that Trump would not be greeted warmly.', 'Making his first public appearance since Comey’s dismissal, McCabe promised to tell the Senate committee if he came under pressure to shut down the investigation into possible links between Trump’s associates and Russia during last year’s election.', 'He said he had met Trump this week but the Russian investigation did not come up.', 'Asked by Senator Marco Rubio if Comey’s abrupt dismissal would impede the work of the FBI, McCabe was adamant.', 'You cannot stop the men and women of the FBI from doing the right thing and upholding the constitution, he said.', 'Later he said the Russian investigation would be pursued vigorously and completely.', 'To reports of Comey having asked for more resources for the investigation, McCabe said he was not aware of any such request and insisted the Russian investigation had the resources it needed.', 'Opening the hearing on global threats that heard evidence from the heads of the main US intelligence agencies, the committee’s Republican chairman, Richard Burr, said it would not be solely focused on the Trump-Russia enquiry.', 'However, Democratic senators repeatedly returned to the issue.', 'It is impossible to ignore that one of the leaders of the intelligence community is not here with us today, said the top Democrat on the committee, Mark Warner.', 'The president’s firing of FBI director Comey … was a shocking development.', 'The timing of Director Comey’s dismissal to me and many committee members on both sides of the aisle is especially troubling.', 'He was leading an active counterintelligence investigation into any links between the Trump campaign and the Russian government or its representatives, and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russia’s efforts to interfere in our election.', 'For many people, including myself, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that the president’s decision to remove Director Comey was related to this investigation.', 'And that is unacceptable.', 'It emerged on Wednesday evening that the committee had issued a subpoena for the president’s former national security adviser Michael Flynn, requesting documents relevant to the committee’s investigation into Russian interference with the 2016 election.', 'Comey – who found out he had been fired when the news flashed up on a screen behind him when he was addressing staff in Los Angeles – sent a farewell letter to FBI staff on Wednesday.', 'It is very hard to leave a group of people who are committed only to doing the right thing, he wrote.', 'My hope is that you will continue to live our values and the mission of protecting the American people and upholding the constitution.']\n",

it means that they’ve been found floating in the space between cells.', 'And that’s any food, not just GMOs.', 'DNA from GMOs behave no differently than DNA from organic or conventional foods.', 'If you aren’t concerned about the DNA from blueberries transferring into you, then you should not be concerned about DNA from GMOs either.', 'The paper’s deepest flaw is that a negative control was not included in the sequencing experiments.', 'Several recent papers (see here and here) have outlined the importance of including a negative control in experiments where there is very little DNA to account for possible contaminants from the environment and reagents.', '(For a lay introduction to the concept of contaminants in sequencing, see here).', '3) New Study Links GMOs To Gluten Disorders That Affect 18 Million Americans.', 'The article quotes for an alleged study by the Institute for Responsible Technology (IRT).', 'But there is no study on the link of GMOs to gluten allergies.', 'There’s a link to a post on a webpage, but there isn’t a peer-reviewed article.', 'IRT is a one-man band run by activist Jeffrey Smith.', 'It is an NGO that advocates for the elimination of GMOs from our food supply.', 'It’s not a university, college or research institution.', 'It doesn’t do studies.', 'I’ve written about gluten allergies and GMOs.', 'The Celiac Disease foundation has spoken out against the IRT’s report.', 'GMO wheat has not been commercialized, so any association of gluten allergies with the consumption of GMO wheat is on its face absurd.', 'As for charts that track an increase in GMO consumption in general and gluten allergies, it’s a case of association with no causation (i.e.', 'the incidence of gluten allergies have increased over the past decade and the amount of GMOs we eat have increased too.', 'But, so have the number of plasma screens manufactured).', '4) Study Links Genetically Modified Corn to Rat Tumors.', 'This claim is the infamous Seralini paper, which was retracted, and recently republished, in a different journal without being peer reviewed.', 'The paper identified tumors in rats that were fed GMOs and/or the herbicide glyphosate longterm.', 'But the strain of rat used was predisposed to tumors.', 'The paper did not perform statistical analyses and used too few rats, so it was not possible to determine if the tumors were due to the food, the chemical or to the fact that the strain of rats would get tumors regardless of what they were fed.', 'Finally, the findings from Seralini’s paper are contrary to other long-term feeding studies.', 'An overview of the criticisms regarding this paper can be found here.', '5) Glyphosate Induces Human Breast Cancer Cells Growth via Estrogen Receptors.', 'This claim relates to glyphosate, an herbicide used in tandem with herbicide resistant genetically modified crops.', 'The cited paper examines the impact of glyphosate on breast cancer cell growth.', 'In approximately 80 percent of instances of breast cancer, the diseased cells are hormone sensitive, meaning they need estrogen in order to proliferate and spread.', 'These researchers took two breast cancer cell lines: one was estrogen sensitive and one was not, and they examined the impact of increasing amounts of glyphosate on cell growth.', 'They found that glyphosate has similar impact on breast cancer growth as estrogen, although the relationship was not as strong, and it did not have an impact on the proliferation of the non-hormone sensitive breast cancer cell line.', 'The paper had numerous technical problems, including the absence of data on controls, a potentially critical omission.', 'Additionally, there actually seems to be a protective effect at higher concentrations of glyphosate: instead of reaching a saturation point where the addition of glyphosate no longer has an effect on cell growth, there is no significant difference in cellular growth between the cells that received the highest doses of glyphosate and the controls (which is why the data from the controls is an important factor).', 'This experiment was done with cells in a petri dish—what’s called an in vitro tissue-culture experiment.', 'Such research is of limited real-world value.', 'The cells are often finicky and need plenty of TLC in order to grow well; different cell lines can also behave very differently.', 'The authors of the paper note some of these issues, along with the fact that their data doesn’t mesh with previous studies that have examined the impact of glyphosate on cellular proliferation (this previous paper suggests that glyphosate actually protects against cell proliferation in vitro in eight different cancer cell lines and that glyphosate might be developed into an anti-cancer drug!', ').', 'Monsanto wrote a response to the paper noting that many studies examined the potential carcinogenicity of glyphosate and none has found that the compound causes cancer.', 'Some news reports misinterpreted the study, writing that researchers concluded that glyphosate causes cancer when that is not the researchers’ findings: they suggest glyphosate may cause breast cancer to proliferate.', 'Monsanto pointed out that even this finding is contrary to the body of evidence that exists on the topic.', 'The authors admit to this fact and discuss the appropriate next steps to examine this issue in mice/rats models for breast cancer.', 'I think that that’s a great next step.', 'I’d also look at a few more breast-cancer cell lines.', 'This is the most compelling research paper that I’ve read about that suggests a potential health risk surrounding glyphosate.', 'But the study must be reproduced and its issues ironed out.', 'However, as I mentioned, the paper isn’t really about GMOs as a class: keep in mind that only a fraction of GMOs are glyphosate resistant (i.e.', 'Round-up Ready crops) and the use of glyphosate is not limited to GMOs.', 'Additionally, the paper does several experiments with a compound in soybean whose impact on breast cancer cell growth is very similar to that of glyphosate’s—meaning that there are natural compounds in our food that seem to have the same impact on breast-cancer proliferation that this paper’s findings suggest for glyphosate.', 'There does not seem to be a scientific consensus on the topic of soy intake in breast cancer patients, although several publications have examined this issue without finding a positive correlation (examples here, here, and here).', '6) Glyphosate Linked To Birth Defects.', 'No peer reviewed, published scientific study makes such claims.', 'The source of this health concern is a publication by Earth Open Source, an anti-GMO NGO co-founded by an individual who also owns a GMO-testing and certification company, and whose business would clearly benefit through the promotion of anti-GMO sentiments (see About the Authors in this document).', '7) Study Links Glyphosate To Autism, Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s.', 'The paper that led to this health claim does not constitute research.', 'It’s a hypothesis and no research was done to support the hypothesis.', 'The paper was reviewed by science journalist Keith Kloor at Discover Magazine who aptly compared it to a Glenn Beck chalkboard drawing.', 'The claims were printed in a pay-for-play journal (also known as predatory journal), meaning that for a fee, one can get nearly anything published.', 'There have been several exposés on pay-for-play journals, and many scientists believe that the phenomenon is eroding the quality of science (here’s an overview from Nature.com; here’s an exposé of pay for play journals).', '8) Chronically Ill Humans Have Higher Glyphosate Levels Than Healthy Humans.', 'This claim is based on a paper published in the Journal of Environmental and Analytical Toxicology, owned by the Omics publishing group- a notorious predatory publishing company.', 'The authors examined glyphosate levels in humans and different animals.', 'There’s no indication of what the animals were fed, how much, how they were kept or myriad other variables.', 'Any of these could invalidate the study.', 'The researchers do not say anything about the age, sex, weight, height, or genetic background of the humans, or how much they ate, if they washed their food, how long they had been eating organic/conventional diets and, most mind-blowing of all, there’s absolutely no definition for what constitutes being chronically ill. Any single issue that I’ve listed here would be considered a fatal flaw that would exclude the paper from publication in a more prestigious journal.', '9) Studies Link GMO Animal Feed to Severe Stomach Inflammation and Enlarged Uteri in Pigs.', 'In the study on which this claim is based, the researchers gave pigs GMO feed and non-GMO feed and identified the differences between the two groups.', 'The paper has been thoroughly challenged by many journalists and scientists:.', 'Journalist Mark Lynas highlighted the degree to which the data is cherry-picked.', 'The difference in inflammation between the GM-fed and non-GM-fed pigs is apparent only when you break down the degree of inflammation into subcategories, but there’s no difference if you view it as a single category.', 'Overall, there’s a high rate of inflammation for both groups, which is not explained in the paper.', 'At the same time, there are several parameters where GM-feed could be argued as having a protective effect (there are 50 percent fewer heart-abnormalities in pigs fed GM-grain), but this isn’t discussed.', 'As explained by geneticist Anastasia Bodnar, the authors do not analyze the compositional differences in the feed between the two groups.', 'Previous studies have determined that the environment (i.e., water, soil, geography) of a crop has a greater impact on proteins and metabolites than whether or not the crop is a GMO.', 'As such, the differences seen in the pigs may not be due pesticides or presence/absence of the transgenic protein; rather, they are most likely due to differences in composition of the feed.', 'Geneticist Val Giddings notes that the animals had abnormally high rates of pneumonia, which points to the possibility that something wonky was going on.', 'In conclusion, even if the paper’s findings are real, there’s no knowing whether that’s due to something associated with transgenes or not, because the researchers do not account for natural variation in the feed.', '10) GMO risk assessment is based on very little scientific evidence in the sense that the testing methods recommended are not adequate to ensure safety.', 'Let’s set aside the fact that this isn’t a Scientific Study Proving GMOs Can Be Harmful To Human Health, which is the claim set out in the title.', 'There are three papers associated with this bullet point.', 'The first one is a review and I agree with a few of the points it makes.', 'It highlights the need for standardized tests and statistics in animal feeding studies for GMOs, and anyone who followed the Seralini debacle would probably agree.', 'It summarizes papers that have performed feeding studies and their results.', 'However, the review does not remove flawed papers from their overview and nor does it distinguish between feeding studies for GMO crops that have been commercialized vs. crops that have never been submitted for regulatory approval.', 'The paper does not conclude, GMO risk assessment is based on very little scientific evidence.', 'The second paper is also a review piece.', 'The first author is affiliated with Friends of the Earth, an anti-GMO NGO.', 'It does not constitute novel research and has a clear editorial slant.', 'The third paper does not even qualify as a review.', 'It’s a commentary published in 2002 in Nature Biotechnology, which is a high caliber journal.', 'It outlined possible unintended consequences that could happen with a GMO—none of which have ever been documented or identified since then, to the best of my knowledge.', 'In conclusion, despite the title of the article, none of these studies proves or even persuasively suggests that GMOs can be harmful to human health.', 'The majority are either obviously flawed or are not scientific studies.', 'The current scientific consensus regarding GMOs remains unchanged: they are safe and do not pose a health risk to humans.', 'However, a scientific consensus is subject to change if there is sufficient reproducible evidence that may impact it, but none of the studies reviewed here constitute such evidence.']\n",

complete ban is Russia after top government scientists recommended at least a 10 year ban.', 'The truth is, we don’t know enough about GMOs to deem them safe for human consumption.', 'Believe it or not the very first commercial sale of them was only twenty years ago.', 'There is no possible way that our health authorities can test all possible combinations on a large enough population, over a long enough period of time to be able to say with absolute certainty that they are harmless.', 'There are a multitude of credible scientific studies that clearly demonstrate why GMOs should not be consumed, and more are emerging every year.', 'There are also a number of scientists all around the world that oppose them.', 'By slipping it into our food without our knowledge, without any indication that there are genetically modified organisms in our food, we are now unwittingly part of a massive experiment.The FDA has said that genetically modified organisms are not much different from regular food, so they’ll be treated in the same way.', 'The problem is this, geneticists follow the inheritance of genes, what biotechnology allows us to do is to take this organism, and move it horizontally into a totally unrelated species.', 'Now David Suzuki doesn’t normally mate with a carrot and exchange genes, what biotechnology allows us to do is to switch genes from one to the other

modified foods in maternal, fetal and non-pregnant women’s blood.', 'They also found the presence of Monsanto’s Bt toxin.', 'The study was published in the Journal Reproductive Toxicology in 2011.', '(1) You can read the FULL study here.', 'Given the potential toxicity of these environmental pollutants and the fragility of the fetus, more studies are needed, particularly those using the placental transfer approach.', 'Thus, our present results will provide baseline data for future studies exploring a new area of research relating to nutrition, toxicology and reproduction in women.', 'Today, obstetric-gynecological disorders that are associated with environmental chemicals are not known.', 'Thus, knowing the actual concentration of genetically modified foods in humans constitutes a cornerstone in the advancement of research in this area.', '(1).', 'The study used blood samples from thirty pregnant women and thirty non-pregnant women.', 'The study also pointed out that the fetus is considered to be highly susceptible to the adverse affects of xenobiotics (foreign chemical substance found within an organism that is not naturally produced.)', 'This is why the study emphasizes that knowing more about GMOs is crucial, because environmental agents could disrupt the biological events that are required to ensure normal growth and development.', '2.', 'DNA From Genetically Modified Crops Can Be Transferred Into Humans Who Eat Them.', 'In a new study published in the peer reviewed Public Library of Science (PLOS), researchersemphasize that there is sufficient evidence

pass directly to the circulatory system.', 'During digestion proteins and DNA are thought to be degraded into small constituents, amino acids and nucleic acids, respectively, and then absorbed by a complex active process and distributed to various parts of the body through the circulation system.', 'Here, based on the analysis of over 1000 human samples from four independent studies, we report evidence that meal-derived DNA fragments which are large enough to carry complete genes can avoid degradation and through an unknown mechanism enter the human circulation system.', 'In one of the blood samples the relative concentration of plant DNA is higher than the human DNA.', 'The plant DNA concentration shows a surprisingly precise log-normal distribution in the plasma samples while

of Medicine (4) and will soon be published in the journal Food and Chemical Toxicology.', 'Several recent studies showed glyphosate’s potential to be an endocrine disruptor.', 'Endocrine disruptors are chemicals that can interfere with the hormone system in mammals.', 'These disruptors can cause developmental disorders, birth defects and cancer tumors.', '(6).', 'Glyphosate exerted proliferative effects only in human hormone-dependent breast cancer.', 'We found that glyphosate exhibited a weaker estrogenic activity than estradiol.', 'Furthermore, this study demonstrated the additive estrogenic effects of glyphosate and genisein which implied that the use of contaminated soybean products as dietary supplements may pose a risk of breast cancer because of their potential additive estrogenicity.', '(6).', 'Researchers also determined that Monsanto’s roundup is considered an xenoestrogen, which is a foreign estrogen that mimics real estrogen in our bodies.', 'This can cause a number of problems that include an increased risk of various cancers, early onset of puberty, thyroid issues, infertility and more.', '6.', 'Glyphosate Linked To Birth Defects.', 'A group of scientists put together a comprehensive review of existing data that shows how European regulators have known that Monsanto’s glyphosate causes a number of birth malformations since at least 2002.', 'Regulators misled the public about glyphosate’s safety, and in Germany the Federal Office for Consumer Protection and Food Safety told the European Commission that there was no evidence to suggest that glyphosate causes birth defects.', '(7).', 'Our examination of the evidence leads us to the conclusion that the current approval of glyphosate and Roundup is deeply flawed and unreliable.', 'In this report, we examine the industry studies and regulatory documents that led to the approval of glyphosate.', 'We show that industry and regulators knew as long ago as the 1980s and 1990s that glyphosate causes malformation – but that this information was not made public.', 'We demonstrate how EU regulators reasoned their way from clear evidence of glyphosate’s teratogenicity in industry’s own studies to a conclusion that minimized these findings in the EU Commission’s final review report (7).', 'Here is a summary of the report:.', 'Multiple peer-reviewed scientific literature documenting serious health hazards posed by glyphosate.', 'Industry (including Monsanto) has known since the 1980?s that glyphosate causes malformations in experimental animals at high doses.',

Commission’s expert scientific review panel knew in 1999 that glyphosate causes malformations.', 'The EU Commission has known since 2002 that glyphosate causes malformations.', 'This was the year DG SANCO division published its final review report, laying out the basis for the current approval of glyphosate.', 'Another study published by the American Chemical Society, from the university of Buenos Aires, Argentina also showed that Glyphosate can cause abnormalities.', '(8).', 'The direct effect of glyphosate on early mechanisms of morphogenesis in vertebrate embryos opens concerns about

Glyphosate, you are in essence altering the chemistry of your body.', 'It’s completely unnatural and the body doesn’t resonate with it.', 'P450 (CYP) is the gene pathway disrupted when the body takes in Glyphosate.', 'P450 creates enzymes that assist with the formation of molecules in cells, as well as breaking them down.', 'CYP enzymes are abundant and have many important functions.', 'They are responsible for detoxifying xenobiotics from the body, things like the various chemicals found in pesticides, drugs and carcinogens.', 'Glyphosate inhibits the CYP enzymes.', 'The CYP pathway is critical for normal, natural functioning of multiple biological systems within our bodies.', 'Because humans that’ve been exposed to glyphosate have a drop in amino acid tryptophan levels, they do not have the necessary active signalling of the neurotransmitter serotonin, which is associated with weight gain, depression and Alzheimer’s disease.', '(9).', '8.', 'Chronically Ill Humans Have Higher Glyphosate Levels Than Healthy Humans.', 'A new study out of Germany concludes that Glyphosate residue could reach humans and animals through feed and can be excreted in urine.', 'It outlines how presence of glyphosate in urine and its accumulation in animal tissues is alarming even at low concentrations.', '(10).', 'To this day, Monsanto continues to advertise its Roundup products as environmentally friendly and claims that neither animals nor humans are affected by this toxin.', 'Environmentalists, veterinarians, medical doctors and scientists however, have raised increasing alarms about the danger of glyphosate in the animal and human food chain as well as the environment.', 'The fact that glyphosate has been found in animals and humans is of great concern.', 'In search for the causes of serious diseases amongst entire herds of animals in northern Germany, especially cattle, glyphosate has repeatedly been detected in the urine, feces, milk and feed of the animals.',

scientist Judy Carman, PhD that was recently published in the peer reviewed journal Organic Systems outlines the effects of a diet mixed with GMO feed for pigs, and how it is a cause for concern when it comes to health.', '(11) Scientists randomized and fed isowean pigs either a mixed GM soy and GM corn (maize) diet for approximately 23 weeks (nothing out of the ordinary for most pigs in the United States), which is unfortunately the normal lifespan of a commercial pig from weaning to slaughter.', 'Equal numbers of male and female pigs were present in each group.', 'The GM diet was associated with gastric and uterine differences in pigs.', 'GM pigs had uteri that were 25% heavier than non-GM fed pigs.', 'GM-fed pigs had a higher rate of severe stomach inflammation with a rate of 32% compared to 125 of non-GM fed pigs.', 'The study concluded that pigs fed a GMO diet exhibited a heavier uteri and a higher rate of severe stomach inflammation than pigs who weren’t fed a GMO diet.', 'Because the use of GMO feed for livestock and humans is so widespread, this is definitely another cause for concern when it comes to GMO consumption.', 'Humans have a similar gastrointestinal tract to pigs, and these GM crops are consumed widely by people, especially in the United States.', '10.', 'GMO risk assessment is based on very little scientific evidence in the sense that the testing methods recommended are not adequate to ensure safety.', '(12)(13)(14).', 'Deficiencies have been revealed numerous times with regards to testing GM foods.', 'The first guidelines were originally designed to regulate the introduction of GM microbes and plants into the environment with no attention being paid to food safety concerns.', 'However, they have been widely cited as adding authoritative scientific support to food safety assessment.', 'Additionally, the Statement of Policy released by the Food and Drug Administration of the United States, presumptively recognizing the GM foods as GRAS (generally recognized as safe), was prepared while there were critical guidelines prepared by the International Life Sciences Institute Europe and FAO/WHO recommend that safety evaluation should be based on the concept of substantial equivalence, considering parameters such as molecular characterization, phenotypic characteristics, key nutrients, toxicants and allergens.', 'Since 2003, official standards for food safety assessment have been published by the Codex Alimentarius Commission of FAO/WHO.', 'Published reviews with around 25 peer-reviewed studies have found that despite the guidelines, the risk assessment of GM foods has not followed a defined prototype.', '(12) (15).', 'The risk assessment of genetically modified (GM) crops for human nutrition and health has not been systematic.', 'Evaluations for each GM crop or trait have been conducted using different feeding periods, animal models and parameters.', 'The most common results is that GM and conventional sources include similar nutritional performance and growth in animals.', 'However, adverse microscopic and molecular effects of some GM foods in different organs or tissues have been reported.', 'While there are currently no standardized methods to evaluate the safety of GM foods, attempts towards harmonization are on the way.', 'More scientific effort is necessary in order to build confidence in the evaluation and acceptance of GM foods.', '(12) (15).', 'So, if anybody ever tells you that GMOs are completely safe for consumption, it’s not true.', 'We just don’t know enough

media blitz from conservative outlets — many of which were eager for something to talk about besides the scandals swirling around Donald Trump.', 'Fox News’s Sean Hannity was one of the most enthusiastic rumormongers, devoting segments on three separate occasions last week to Rich.', 'Even after Fox News retracted its story, Hannity promised he would continue to investigate.', 'I retracted nothing, he said defiantly on his radio show Tuesday.', 'Rich’s family has been begging right-wing news outlets to stop spreading unfounded rumors about him, but by now the situation seems to have gotten out of control.', 'In death, Rich has become a martyr to the right, buoyed by a host of characters each with their own ulterior motives: There is WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who wants to downplay the connections between WikiLeaks and the Russians; there are the Clinton haters, who want to spread the', 'idea that the Clintons are murderers; there are the Trump supporters, who want to minimize the idea that Russian hackers helped deliver the election to their candidate; and there are the talking heads on Fox News, who last week needed something other than negative Trump stories to make conversation about.', 'We might not know who killed Seth Rich, but we do know who turned his legacy into a textbook study of where fake news comes from, how it spreads, and the victims it creates.', 'Seth Rich was murdered in a senseless act of violence.', 'Seth Rich worked in Democratic politics for most of his career.', 'He grew up and went to college in Omaha, Nebraska, where as a student he volunteered on two Democratic Senate campaigns.', 'After graduating, he moved to Washington, DC, for a job at Greenberg Quinlan Rosner, a progressive opinion research and consulting

factors helped make Rich a target of speculation:.', 'The murderers left behind Rich’s valuables.', '(Though, by that same paranoid logic, wouldn’t a professional hitman have taken Rich’s wallet and

campaign to access private voter data collected by the Clinton campaign.', 'Hillary Clinton had just clinched the nomination after a surprisingly bruising primary, and there were still sore feelings in the air.', 'There’s a long-running conspiracy theory that the Clintons have assassinated dozens of their political enemies.', 'If those facts don’t seem to add up to a coherent story, well, you’re thinking too hard.', 'Conspiracy theories don’t operate logically.', 'They start from an assumption — for instance, the Clintons are shady — and spiral outward in search of corroboration.', 'On

Clintons:.', 'Rich’s former employer, Greenberg Quinlan Rosner, once did some consulting work for British Petroleum.', \"(Is it possible that Mr. Rich was aware of the public's disdain for oil

timing in politics, I believe Seth Rich was murdered by corrupt politicians for knowing too much information on election fraud.', 'Others on Twitter and the trolling website 4chan also speculated that Rich might have crossed the Clintons in some way.', 'Rich’s death seemed to fit in with the Clinton body count theory, which dates to the 1990s and claims that the Clintons are so vindictive that they hire hitmen to murder people they don’t like.', 'People who believe the Clintons are murderers often point to deputy White House counsel Vince Foster, who suffered from clinical depression and died of a gunshot wound to the mouth in 1993.', 'Several investigations all ruled Foster’s death a suicide, but some conservatives insisted there must have been foul play.', 'They claimed that Foster, who was looking into the Clintons’ taxes, may have uncovered evidence of corruption in connection to the Whitewater controversy, a guilt-by-association scandal involving friends of the Clintons’.', 'The

of the DNC’s emails.', 'The thought of Russian interference in American politics was infuriating to Rich, according to one person who was very close to him, the Washington Post reported: It was crazy.', 'Especially for Seth.', 'He said, ‘Oh, my God.', 'We have a foreign entity trying to get involved in our elections?’ That made him so angry.', 'When WikiLeaks released its dump of DNC emails on July 22, the obvious explanation was that it had obtained those emails from the Russian hackers.', 'This connection was later confirmed by top US intelligence agencies, who concluded with high confidence that DNC servers were hacked by top Russian government hackers, who had then given the emails to WikiLeaks.', 'Moscow most likely chose WikiLeaks because of its self-proclaimed reputation for authenticity, the US intelligence report explained, as well as for its connection to the Russian propaganda outlet Russia Today.', 'But WikiLeaks has repeatedly denied its ties to Russia, and ever since last summer it has used Seth Rich as a way to distract from claims that it abetted Russian interference in the US election.', 'WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange had his own reasons to fear a Clinton presidency — as secretary of state, Clinton wanted to indict Assange for his involvement in releasing the millions of US diplomatic cables leaked by Chelsea Manning.', 'On Dutch television in August 2016, Assange hinted that Rich, not Russia, may have been the source for the WikiLeaks emails.', 'Whistleblowers go to significant efforts to get us material, and often very significant risks,

think it’s a concerning situation; there’s not a conclusion yet.', 'As part of its investigation, WikiLeaks offered a $20,000 prize in August for information about Rich’s murder.', 'This is the point where Seth Rich became a prop in a game of international espionage.', 'Trump supporters and the alt-right amplified the theory that Rich was some kind of Democratic whistleblower or leaker, even though the facts didn’t really fit this pattern.', 'He didn’t have access to the DNC emails, and he had never shown any prowess at hacking — being a data analyst involves a very different set of skills.', 'Besides, the DNC wasn’t the only organization that was hacked: Clinton campaign chair John Podesta’s personal emails, for instance, were stolen separately, as were the emails at the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.', 'Nevertheless, many on the right were inspired by the WikiLeaks insinuations and started to concoct their own conspiracy theories about Rich’s murder.', 'In August, former House speaker and presidential candidate Newt Gingrich told a conservative talk show host that Rich’s death was suspicious.', 'First of all, of course it’s worth talking about, he said.', 'And if Assange says he is the source, Assange may know.', 'That’s not complicated.', 'That same month, Trump adviser Roger Stone claimed, without evidence, that Rich was murdered on his way to meet with the FBI to discuss election fraud.', 'To Trump supporters, the claim that Rich had been murdered by the Clintons had twofold appeal: It reinforced the rumor that the Clintons were shady operatives, and it distracted from the mounting evidence that Russia had interfered with the US election — possibly in collusion with the Trump campaign.', 'In the presidential debate on September 26, Trump famously suggested that it could have been a lone hacker who was responsible for the stolen DNC emails.', 'It could be Russia, but it could also be China.', 'It could also be lots of other people.', 'It also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds, he said.', 'Thanks to a weird miscommunication, the conspiracy theory comes back in May.', 'After the election, the conspiracy theories about Seth Rich faded from public consciousness, as the focus turned instead to the FBI’s investigation of connections between Trump staffers and Russian agents.', 'Suspicions still bubbled in right-wing corners of Reddit and on alt-right websites like Gateway Pundit, and Assange continued to claim that it wasn’t the Russians who provided the hacked emails — but most of America had moved on.', 'But Rich returned to the news last week, when the local TV station FOX 5 DC aired an interview with private investigator Rod Wheeler, who claimed that sources in the FBI told him there was evidence of a connection between Rich and WikiLeaks:.', 'FOX 5 DC: You have sources at the FBI saying that there is information.', 'WHEELER: For sure.', 'FOX 5 DC: .', '.that could link Seth Rich to WikiLeaks?.', 'WHEELER: Absolutely.', 'Yeah.', \"That's confirmed.\", 'Conservative media outlets jumped on the story, which aired the night of Monday, May 15.', 'By Tuesday morning, conservative outlets like Breitbart, the Blaze, and the Daily Caller all had their own pieces relaying Wheeler’s claims.', 'On Tuesday, Fox News added its own revelation: It claimed that an unnamed federal investigator had confirmed that Rich had been in contact with WikiLeaks.', 'I have seen and read the emails between Seth Rich and Wikileaks, the source said, according to Fox News.', 'Fox News additionally claimed this source had evidence that Rich had given thousands of DNC emails to WikiLeaks.', 'This was a two-source story: The report also said that Wheeler had independently corroborated what the anonymous federal investigator had told Fox News.', 'But here’s where it gets confusing.', 'By Tuesday afternoon, Wheeler told CNN that he had misspoken.', 'It turns out he didn’t have any evidence of his own.', 'What had happened, apparently, was that earlier in the week, Fox News had contacted Wheeler for its own story on Rich.', 'That was when Wheeler learned that Fox News had a source alleging there was contact between Rich and WikiLeaks.', 'When Wheeler went on local TV on Monday night to talk about Rich, he believed he was giving viewers a preview of the Fox News story set to run on Tuesday.', 'That, at least, is how Wheeler explained the situation to CNN last Tuesday.', 'Somehow, through miscommunication or sloppy reporting, the Fox News report used Wheeler to back up its claims about the Rich-WikiLeaks connection.', 'This was incorrect, Wheeler said.', 'He had no independent knowledge.', 'I only got that [information] from the reporter at Fox News, he told CNN.', 'Yesterday, after leaving it up for a week, Fox News finally retracted its Seth Rich story, which was down to one anonymous source.', 'The article was not initially subjected to the high degree of editorial scrutiny we require for all our reporting, an editor’s note explained.', 'Upon appropriate review, the article was found not to meet those standards and has since been removed.', 'Conservative media has a field day.', 'It’s unlikely that any of this would have been a big deal had there not been a stunning series of damaging reports about Donald Trump last week.', 'Among other things, it was revealed that Trump had shared state secrets with the Russians, that he had pressured FBI Director James Comey to drop his investigation into ties between Trump affiliates and Russia, and that the Russia probe had reached a current high-level White House official, who many suspect is Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner.', 'One way the conservative media minimized all the bad news was to focus on other stories.', 'The latest Seth Rich allegations became a welcome distraction from the constant revelations coming out of the Washington Post and the New York Times.', 'For instance, while most outlets were covering the revelation that Trump had volunteered classified information to Russians, the alt-right website Breitbart devoted its front page to the Seth Rich conspiracy.', 'Breitbart even slammed the mainstream media for ignoring the rumors about Rich: Silence from Establishment Media over Seth Rich WikiLeaks Report was the title of one story.', 'Fox News in particular devoted outsize attention to the Rich story, repeatedly rehashing the conspiracy theory.', 'On his 10 pm show, Fox pundit Sean Hannity devoted segments to Rich on Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday last week.', 'I am not backing off asking questions even though there is an effort that nobody talk about Seth Rich, he said on Friday night.', 'On Tuesday, even after Fox News retracted the story that ignited the latest round of speculation, Hannity remained convinced that the Seth Rich conspiracy theory had legs.', 'I am not Fox.com or FoxNews.com, he said on his radio show.', 'I retracted nothing.', \"Later that evening, on his television show, Hannity said that for now, he would stop talking about Rich out of respect for the family's wishes.\", 'On Twitter, though, he was defiant, claiming that liberal fascism was trying to silence his voice.', 'Ok TO BE CLEAR, I am closer to the TRUTH than ever, he tweeted.', 'Not only am I not stopping, I am working harder.', 'Please retweet, he added.', 'Rich was an unlucky victim of the conservative media.', 'The recent attention has reignited the old Seth Rich conspiracy theories, bringing forth even more unsubstantiated claims.', 'On Fox News’s Sunday morning talk show, Newt Gingrich repeated his belief that Rich, not Russia, was responsible for the DNC hack.', 'It turns out, it wasn’t the Russians, he said.', 'It was this young guy who, I suspect, was disgusted by the corruption of the Democratic National Committee.', 'On Monday, Assange issued a cryptic tweet using the hashtag #SethRich which fanned the flames even further: WikiLeaks has never disclosed a source.', 'Sources sometimes talk to other parties but identities never emerge from WikiLeaks.', '#SethRich.', 'And on Tuesday, New Zealand file-sharing entrepreneur Kim Dotcom, who is wanted by the US government for copyright infringement and racketeering, claimed that Rich had personally contacted him in 2014, and that the two had talked about a number of topics including corruption and the influence of corporate money in politics.', 'I know that Seth Rich was involved in the DNC leak, Dotcom wrote in a statement.', 'Rich’s family has repeatedly asked news outlets to stop publicizing these rumors.', 'Those theories, which some reporters have since retracted, are baseless, and they are unspeakably cruel, Mary and Joel Rich wrote in a Washington Post op-ed on Tuesday evening.', 'Imagine that instead, every call that comes in is a reporter asking what you think of a series of lies or conspiracies about the death, they wrote.', 'That nightmare is what our family goes through every day.', 'The Riches also pushed back on some of the rumors themselves, stating that the FBI had found no evidence of communication between their son and WikiLeaks, and that Seth had no access to any of the DNC emails that were leaked:.', 'Despite these facts, our family’s nightmare persists.', 'Seth’s death has been turned into a political football.', 'Every day we wake up to new headlines, new lies, new factual errors, new people approaching us to take advantage of us and Seth’s legacy.', 'It just won’t stop.', 'The amount of pain and anguish this has caused us is unbearable.', 'With every conspiratorial flare-up, we are forced to relive Seth’s murder and a small piece of us dies as more of Seth’s memory is torn away from us.', 'But to conspiracy theorists, the facts have never mattered.', 'Fake news always has ulterior motives, and everybody who amplified the Seth Rich conspiracy theories had their own stake in keeping the lies alive.']\n",

election cycle, but Hillary Clinton is now trying to turn it into one, with the help of global warming guru Al Gore.', 'Unfortunately for the climate change alarmists, despite all the celebrity endorsements and high-minded rhetoric, the facts keep getting in the way.', 'Here are nine things you need to know about the climate change hoax.', '1.', 'The Climategate scandal proved that key data involving man-made climate change was manipulated.', \"In 2009, the public discovered emails from the University of East Anglia's Climatic Research Unit exposing how scientists who have been enormously influential in promoting the concept of man-made climate change actually attempted to cook the books to obtain results that served their narrative that the planet was heating at a dangerous trend due to higher levels of carbon dioxide.\", 'One of these scientists included Dr. James Hansen, a former NASA climatologist who is known by some as the father or grandfather of the climate change myth, as it was his Model Zero that first introduced the concept of global warming.', 'Hansen, Philip Jones, Michael Mann, et al.', \"were all involved in trying to lower past temperatures and to 'adjust' recent temperatures upwards, in order to convey the impression of an accelerated warming, according to the leaked emails.\", 'The emails also revealed how this cabal of scientists would discuss various ways to stonewall the public from seeing the background data on which their findings and temperature records were based, even going as far as deleting significant amounts of data.', \"They would engage in efforts to smear any scientific journal which dares to publish their critics' work.\", '2.', 'The Climategate scandal was given new life in 2011, with the release of new emails.', 'The new round of leaked emails at the time provided more teeth to the revelations of 2009.', 'Here are a couple of egregious emails from Jones found, via Forbes:.', 'I’ve been told that IPCC is above national FOI [Freedom of Information] Acts.', 'One way to cover yourself and all those working in AR5 would be to delete all emails at the end of the process, writes Phil Jones, a scientist working with the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), in a newly released email.', 'Any work we have done in the past is done on the back of the research grants we get – and has to be well hidden, Jones writes in another newly released email.', 'I’ve discussed this with the main funder (U.S. Dept of Energy) in the past and they are happy about not releasing the original station data.', 'An email written by Mann showed that he tried to get an investigative journalist to investigate and expose a climate skeptic scientist named Steven McIntyre.', '3.', 'NASA may have also been involved in manipulating data to serve the narrative of man-made climate change.', 'The Washington Times reported in 2009: Under pressure in 2007, NASA recalculated its data and found that 1934, not 1998, was the hottest year in its records for the contiguous 48 states.', 'NASA later changed that data again, and now 1998 and 2006 are tied for first, with 1934 slightly cooler.', 'Since this occurred at around the same time as the Climategate scandal, Chris Horner of the Competitive Enterprise Institute filed a lawsuit to get NASA to release their relevant data sets on this issue and was able to expose emails from NASA that revealed a disturbing', \"fact: the agency admitted that its own climate findings were inferior to those maintained by both the University of East Anglia's Climatic Research Unit, reported Fox News in 2010 – meaning NASA climate change data sets were less accurate than the organization embattled with manipulating data sets.\", 'A 2015 Washington Times editorial also highlighted another example of NASA cooking the books:.', 'Paul Homewood, a skeptical researcher, found that in Paraguay, temperature readings for the 20th century at all nine weather stations supervised by NASA had been adjusted to transform a cooling trend into a warming trend.', 'His analysis of readings in the Arctic found that rapid warming between 1920 and 1950 — before human activity could have increased the production of greenhouse gases — were adjusted downward so that the 1980s and ‘90s temperatures would stand out as warmer.', '4.', 'NASA also declared 2014 to be the hottest year on record – despite the fact that they were only 38 percent sure about it.', 'The latter fact was left out of their press release at the time, as well as the fact that 2014 was supposedly hotter than the previous hottest year, 2010, by 0.02C – well within the margin of error of 0.1C that scientists tend to adhere by.', \"The Washington Post attempted to spin in favor of NASA by arguing that NASA simply said that 2014 was the most likely hottest year on record – but their press release unequivocally stated that 2014 was the warmest year on record and leaving out the aforementioned key facts makes such a declaration seem misleading, as it's clearly not a guarantee that 2014 was even likely the hottest year on record.\", '5.', 'There is no evidence that the Earth has been warming in recent years.', 'As The Daily Caller highlights, a recent peer-reviewed study concluded that when accounting for El Ninos and La Ninas – which are the the fluctuations in temperature between the ocean and atmosphere in the east-central Equatorial Pacific that occur on average every two to seven years, according to NOAA – there has been a flat-line temperature trend since 1997.', 'In fact, the study found that the El Ninos and La Ninas disproved the existence of the Tropical Hot Spot, which the Environmental Protection Agency claimed as evidence of carbon dioxide supposedly warming the atmosphere.', '6.', 'The left likes to claim that 97 percent of scientists support the concept of man-made climate change.', \"It's likely closer to 43 percent.\", 'The 97 percent myth stems from a variety of flawed studies, as the Daily Wire explained here.', 'On the other hand, the PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency conducted a survey in 2015 that found that only 43 percent of scientists believe in man-made climate change, which is far from a consensus.', '7.', 'The amount of Arctic sea ice has become quite high.', 'Data from the Danish Meteorological Institute shows that the average [ice] extent over the month [of September] is one of the highest in the last decade, according to Paul Homewood.', 'This runs directly counter to the predictions of the climate change models.', '8.', 'Money from the federal government and leftist organizations fuel a lot of misinformation from man-made global warming alarmists.', 'Climate change alarmism is an extremely lucrative industry.', 'All in all, there have been over $32.5 billion of federal government grants that have funded climate change research from 1989-2009, far more than any research funded by the oil industry.', 'National Review reports:.', 'Last summer, a minority staff report from the U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works gave details on a Billionaire’s Club — a shadowy network of charitable foundations that distribute billions to advance climate alarmism.', 'Shadowy nonprofits such as the Energy Foundation and Tides Foundation distributed billions to far-left green groups such as the Natural Resources Defense Council, which in turn send staff to the EPA who then direct federal grants back to the same green groups.', 'It is incestuous.', 'It is opaque.', 'Major media ignored the report.', 'Mann, one of the scientists mentioned earlier for his role in the Climategate scandal, received nearly $6 million in grants from the federal government.', 'The sources of funding for scientists like Hansen are unknown, the federal government has been resisting Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests to reveal them.', '9.', 'It is patently absurd to link Hurricane Matthew to climate change.', 'Not just because of the aforementioned reasons, but because as Marco Morano points out at Climate Depot, The data show for the last 10 years we have had an unusual drought of landfalling major hurricanes (Category 3 and higher) on the continental U.S. .', 'That’s right, no major hurricanes have made landfall for over a decade, Morano continued.', 'This

election cycle, but Hillary Clinton is now trying to turn it into one, with the help of global warming guru Al Gore.', 'Unfortunately for the climate change alarmists, despite all the celebrity endorsements and high-minded rhetoric, the facts keep getting in the way.', 'Here are nine things you need to know about the climate change hoax.', '1.', 'The Climategate scandal proved that key data involving man-made climate change was manipulated.', \"In 2009, the public discovered emails from the University of East Anglia's Climatic Research Unit exposing how scientists who have been enormously influential in promoting the concept of man-made climate change actually attempted to cook the books to obtain results that served their narrative that the planet was heating at a dangerous trend due to higher levels of carbon dioxide.\", 'One of these scientists included Dr. James Hansen, a former NASA climatologist who is known by some as the father or grandfather of the climate change myth, as it was his Model Zero that first introduced the concept of global warming.', 'Hansen, Philip Jones, Michael Mann, et al.', \"were all involved in trying to lower past temperatures and to 'adjust' recent temperatures upwards, in order to convey the impression of an accelerated warming, according to the leaked emails.\", 'The emails also revealed how this cabal of scientists would discuss various ways to stonewall the public from seeing the background data on which their findings and temperature records were based, even going as far as deleting significant amounts of data.', \"They would engage in efforts to smear any scientific journal which dares to publish their critics' work.\", '2.', 'The Climategate scandal was given new life in 2011, with the release of new emails.', 'The new round of leaked emails at the time provided more teeth to the revelations of 2009.', 'Here are a couple of egregious emails from Jones found, via Forbes:.', 'I’ve been told that IPCC is above national FOI [Freedom of Information] Acts.', 'One way to cover yourself and all those working in AR5 would be to delete all emails at the end of the process, writes Phil Jones, a scientist working with the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), in a newly released email.', 'Any work we have done in the past is done on the back of the research grants we get – and has to be well hidden, Jones writes in another newly released email.', 'I’ve discussed this with the main funder (U.S. Dept of Energy) in the past and they are happy about not releasing the original station data.', 'An email written by Mann showed that he tried to get an investigative journalist to investigate and expose a climate skeptic scientist named Steven McIntyre.', '3.', 'NASA may have also been involved in manipulating data to serve the narrative of man-made climate change.', 'The Washington Times reported in 2009: Under pressure in 2007, NASA recalculated its data and found that 1934, not 1998, was the hottest year in its records for the contiguous 48 states.', 'NASA later changed that data again, and now 1998 and 2006 are tied for first, with 1934 slightly cooler.', 'Since this occurred at around the same time as the Climategate scandal, Chris Horner of the Competitive Enterprise Institute filed a lawsuit to get NASA to release their relevant data sets on this issue and was able to expose emails from NASA that revealed a disturbing', \"fact: the agency admitted that its own climate findings were inferior to those maintained by both the University of East Anglia's Climatic Research Unit, reported Fox News in 2010 – meaning NASA climate change data sets were less accurate than the organization embattled with manipulating data sets.\", 'A 2015 Washington Times editorial also highlighted another example of NASA cooking the books:.', 'Paul Homewood, a skeptical researcher, found that in Paraguay, temperature readings for the 20th century at all nine weather stations supervised by NASA had been adjusted to transform a cooling trend into a warming trend.', 'His analysis of readings in the Arctic found that rapid warming between 1920 and 1950 — before human activity could have increased the production of greenhouse gases — were adjusted downward so that the 1980s and ‘90s temperatures would stand out as warmer.', '4.', 'NASA also declared 2014 to be the hottest year on record – despite the fact that they were only 38 percent sure about it.', 'The latter fact was left out of their press release at the time, as well as the fact that 2014 was supposedly hotter than the previous hottest year, 2010, by 0.02C – well within the margin of error of 0.1C that scientists tend to adhere by.', \"The Washington Post attempted to spin in favor of NASA by arguing that NASA simply said that 2014 was the most likely hottest year on record – but their press release unequivocally stated that 2014 was the warmest year on record and leaving out the aforementioned key facts makes such a declaration seem misleading, as it's clearly not a guarantee that 2014 was even likely the hottest year on record.\", '5.', 'There is no evidence that the Earth has been warming in recent years.', 'As The Daily Caller highlights, a recent peer-reviewed study concluded that when accounting for El Ninos and La Ninas – which are the the fluctuations in temperature between the ocean and atmosphere in the east-central Equatorial Pacific that occur on average every two to seven years, according to NOAA – there has been a flat-line temperature trend since 1997.', 'In fact, the study found that the El Ninos and La Ninas disproved the existence of the Tropical Hot Spot, which the Environmental Protection Agency claimed as evidence of carbon dioxide supposedly warming the atmosphere.', '6.', 'The left likes to claim that 97 percent of scientists support the concept of man-made climate change.', \"It's likely closer to 43 percent.\", 'The 97 percent myth stems from a variety of flawed studies, as the Daily Wire explained here.', 'On the other hand, the PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency conducted a survey in 2015 that found that only 43 percent of scientists believe in man-made climate change, which is far from a consensus.', '7.', 'The amount of Arctic sea ice has become quite high.', 'Data from the Danish Meteorological Institute shows that the average [ice] extent over the month [of September] is one of the highest in the last decade, according to Paul Homewood.', 'This runs directly counter to the predictions of the climate change models.', '8.', 'Money from the federal government and leftist organizations fuel a lot of misinformation from man-made global warming alarmists.', 'Climate change alarmism is an extremely lucrative industry.', 'All in all, there have been over $32.5 billion of federal government grants that have funded climate change research from 1989-2009, far more than any research funded by the oil industry.', 'National Review reports:.', 'Last summer, a minority staff report from the U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works gave details on a Billionaire’s Club — a shadowy network of charitable foundations that distribute billions to advance climate alarmism.', 'Shadowy nonprofits such as the Energy Foundation and Tides Foundation distributed billions to far-left green groups such as the Natural Resources Defense Council, which in turn send staff to the EPA who then direct federal grants back to the same green groups.', 'It is incestuous.', 'It is opaque.', 'Major media ignored the report.', 'Mann, one of the scientists mentioned earlier for his role in the Climategate scandal, received nearly $6 million in grants from the federal government.', 'The sources of funding for scientists like Hansen are unknown, the federal government has been resisting Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests to reveal them.', '9.', 'It is patently absurd to link Hurricane Matthew to climate change.', 'Not just because of the aforementioned reasons, but because as Marco Morano points out at Climate Depot, The data show for the last 10 years we have had an unusual drought of landfalling major hurricanes (Category 3 and higher) on the continental U.S. .', 'That’s right, no major hurricanes have made landfall for over a decade, Morano continued.', 'This
